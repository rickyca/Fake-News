Police went out to the area in Sandy, Utah, after getting a 911 call Tuesday afternoon about a domestic disturbance, said police Sgt. Jason Nielsen.
They found a bullet-ridden car with smashed windows and blood in the middle of a street next to a second car that police say the suspect used as a ram to stop the first car from leaving the neighborhood. An unidentified woman was driving the car in which the victims' were found. Police say she picked up the woman and two juveniles in a car acting as a ""good Samaritan.""
Police found the man, a woman and a boy dead, and a boy and girl injured from gunshot wounds. Nielsen did not have details about the kids' ages and identities or the name and whereabouts of the woman who picked them up. That woman who Nielsen called a ""good Samaritan"" survived, he said.
The injured boy was hospitalized in critical condition. A girl was hospitalized in stable condition.
Investigators were still trying to confirm details about the relationships of those involved.
Nielsen did not immediately know if the gunman killed himself or if someone else involved in the dispute had a gun.
The shooting occurred in the quiet neighborhood with winding roads, nestled against mountains about 20 miles southeast of Salt Lake City. It took place about a half a mile from an elementary school after students had just left for the day.
It was unclear if any children still at the school witnessed the shooting or heard gunshots, Canyons School District spokesman Jeff Haney said.
Resident Colby Corbett was in his backyard waiting for his 8-year-old son to walk home from school when he heard 20 to 30 gunshots within a few seconds.
""I was panicking bad,"" Corbett said. ""I thought it was like a gun battle.""
Corbett said he was relieved when his son arrived soon after, coming from the school and in the opposite direction of the gunfire. His son, Anthony, said he wasn't worried because he thought the gunshots were fireworks.
Ridge Workman, a 14-year-old boy who lives several hundred yards away from the shooting, said he heard seven to eight gunshots and also thought they were fireworks. When he went outside, he saw a car in the street riddled with bullet holes, its windows smashed in and blood nearby.
He called his mother and told her that what was strange was how ""eerily silent"" it was at the scene.","Sandy, Utah Shooting: Mom, Young Son Dead After Gunman Opens Fire on Car - NBC News",normal,b6cdc79d109fcd6b1e5d88d0e6542d88ff6ed888

As the White House tries to push past a series of distractions and focus on Trump’s legislative agenda, the president was scheduled to travel to the Rivertowne Marina in Cincinnati on Wednesday. His speech was expected to make the case for efforts to repair aging levees, dams, locks and ports, as well as his larger public works aims.
During the visit, the president also planned to make remarks on the pending health law overhaul in Congress.
The White House has yet to detail specifics of the plan, which it hopes to achieve largely through public-private partnerships. It has proposed funding the improvements with $200 billion in tax breaks over nine years that would â in theory â leverage $1 trillion worth of construction.
The speech comes a day before former FBI Director James Comey is set to testify in front of Congress and as the White House faces new allegations about possible efforts by the president to influence the investigation into potential ties between his campaign and Russia. Trump has denied the allegations and called the Russia story “fake news.”
Trump, in a tweet early Wednesday, announced his pick for FBI director â Christopher Wray, a former Justice Department official who served as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s personal lawyer during the George Washington Bridge lane-closing investigation.
U.S. inland waterways are critical routes for transporting agricultural products, but officials say they’ve grown old and run down.
The White House has billed this “infrastructure week” and planned a series of events, beginning with a push by the president Monday to privatize the nation’s air traffic control system and separate it from the Federal Aviation Administration.
The president planned to host governors and mayors at the White House on Thursday to discuss the efficient use of tax dollars for infrastructure projects.
While infrastructure was initially seen as an area where Republican and Democrats could work together, Democrats have balked at Trump’s plans for financing improvements, arguing they would result in taxpayer-funded corporate profits, with costs offloaded on consumers.
Mike Toohey, president of the Waterways Council Inc, an inland waterways infrastructure advocacy group, said he was pleased to see the president addressing what he called the “silent r” of the transportation system â rivers. Far more attention is usually paid to roadways, railways and runways, he said.
Still, he said the industry is concerned about Trump’s recent budget proposal, which he said could result in higher costs for the commercial users that finance the waterways’ upkeep.
As a candidate, Trump had promised to invest big money in Cincinnati’s infrastructure, including Interstate 71 and the overcrowded Brent Spence Bridge.
During a campaign stop in Wilmington Ohio last year, Trump said he would redirect billions of dollars in payments to the United Nations to combat climate change and “use that money to invest in America,” including replacing the double-decker bridge.

REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo
Patients notched a rare win over the pharmaceutical industry Monday when the Nevada Legislature revived a bill requiring insulin makers to disclose the profits they make on the life-sustaining drug. In a handful of other states , bills addressing drug prices have stalled.
Many of the 1.25 million Americans who live with Type 1 diabetes cheered the legislative effort in Nevada as an important first step in their fight against skyrocketing costs of a drug on which their lives depend. The cost of insulin medications has steadily risen over the past decade by nearly 300 percent .
Prominent patient advocacy groups, like the American Diabetes Association, have maintained stony silence while diabetes patients championed the bill and lobbied the legislature during this debate — a silence that patients and experts say stems from financial ties.
Many of the dozens of U.S. diabetes advocacy organizations, large and small, garner significant portions of their funding from insulin manufacturers. “Normally all of the patient advocacy groups rally around causes and piggyback on each other in a productive way — that’s what advocacy groups are good at — but that hasn’t been the case here,” said Thom Scher, chief operating officer of Beyond Type 1, which does not accept donations from the pharmaceutical industry. Beyond Type 1 has not issued a formal opinion on the Nevada bill.
Many of the dozens of U.S. diabetes advocacy organizations, large and small, garner significant portions of their funding from insulin manufacturers. The Nevada bill also requires such organizations operating in-state to disclose all contributions they receive from the pharmaceutical industry to discourage that sort of conflict.
In 2016, two of the “big three” insulin producers — Eli Lilly and Sanofi — contributed at least $4.7 million to such national patient advocacy groups as the American Diabetes Association, Diabetes Patient Advocacy Coalition (DPAC), JDRF International and the Diabetes Hands Foundation, according to company disclosures. The third major insulin manufacturer, Novo Nordisk, does not disclose its charitable contributions.
The advocacy groups have taken no position on the Nevada legislation. Generally speaking, their advocacy focuses on pressuring insurers to pay the price of insulin, not protesting price rises.
Local diabetes groups, hardly free from conflicts with the pharmaceutical industry, have also stayed on the sidelines.
The Nevada Diabetes Association for Children and Adults officially issued a neutral opinion.
“The Nevada Diabetes Association supports regulations on medications. The problem with SB 265 is that it is not just regulating medication but the industry.” “The Nevada Diabetes Association supports regulations on medications. The problem with SB 265 is that it is not just regulating medication but the industry,” said Executive Director Sarah Gleich.
The nonprofit does not list its fiscal sponsors on its website or most recent 990 tax form.
“We disclose what we have received, and the IRS does not require that we publicly publish from whom,” Gleich said. “No one is giving out their invitation list to the party.”
Gleich said the Nevada Diabetes Association receives table sponsorships and supplies for camp programs from the pharmaceutical industry but “nothing that would make a dent on the budget.” Auditing non-monetary donations in order to meet the bill’s transparency requirement would be burdensome, Gleich said.
Membership dues accounted for only about $6,000 of the group’s $320,000 in revenue last year , according to its latest tax form.
The American Diabetes Association — which operates a Nevada chapter — accepted at least $3.9 million from Eli Lilly and Sanofi last year.
“The American Diabetes Association believes that no individual in need of lifesaving medications such as insulin should ever go without due to prohibitive costs,” Michelle Kirkwood, its director of strategic communications and media relations, said in a statement. She would not say whether the nonprofit supports the bill.
“… no individual in need of lifesaving medications such as insulin should ever go without due to prohibitive costs.” Former American Diabetes Association president Larry Hausner wrote an op-ed in the Nevada Appeal opposing the legislation. “Caring for people with diabetes involves more than what they pay for insulin or another medication,” Hausner wrote. “As a lifelong patient advocate, I know Nevadans expect more out of their elected officials.” Hausner, now the president of a consulting and public affairs firm, serves on the board of directors of Research!America, a nonprofit promoting increased federal funding for public health research, alongside Sanofi’s president of global research & development, Elias Zerhouni.
The Diabetes Hands Foundation expressed neutrality on the bill. “This state priority in Nevada is a good step towards a larger conversation about the costs of chronic care conditions like diabetes,” said the foundation’s director of advocacy, Mandy Jones. “But it’s hard to know the particular outcome of this particular bill in the U.S. market.”
JDRF International would not comment. DPAC deferred questions to the National Diabetes Volunteer Leadership Council.
Against the backdrop of silence from these patient advocacy groups, a community of diabetes patients on Twitter elevated the bill’s profile around the hashtag #insulin4all, created by T1International, a group in the United Kingdom that does not accept pharmaceutical donations.
“People feel frustrated. At the federal level, we’re not being seen because there’s so much going on politically,” said Erin Gilmer, a Colorado advocate with Type 1 diabetes. “It might have to be a state-by-state movement.”
Sen. Yvanna Cancela, who sponsored the bill, said she believed requiring diabetes advocacy groups to reveal their sources of funding was key to understanding their positions and bringing prices down. “I believe there should be transparency across the health care system,” Cancela said.
Gov. Brian Sandoval said Monday night that he intends to sign the bill , according to a Nevada Independent reporter. If the governor takes no action, the transparency rules become law. The bill, SB539, incorporates provisions of an earlier bill approved by the legislature but vetoed by Sandoval. Sponsors stripped a controversial provision that would have required insulin manufacturers to warn patients 90 days before raising prices, which stoked concerns about drug stockpiling, the Associated Press reported Monday .
“There should be more focus on the one thing we need to survive. … Without insulin, I die a horrendous death in 12 to 24 hours.” The Nevada bill “is definitely a step in the right direction,” said Elizabeth Rowley, founder and director of T1International. “Almost anything requiring more transparency is incredibly important right now, especially at a time when almost all diabetes patient advocacy groups take funding from drug and device companies.”
Laura Marston, an advocate in Washington, D.C., with Type 1 diabetes, said that there is plenty of grass-roots support for legislation on insulin prices but that advocacy organizations are not listening to the right people.
“There should be more focus on the one thing we need to survive. … Without insulin, I die a horrendous death in 12 to 24 hours,” Marston said. “No grass-roots support? There’s desperation.”

Last Updated Jun 7, 2017 12:53 PM EDT 
SANDY , Utah -- Utah school officials say a boy killed in a Tuesday afternoon shooting that also left two adults dead was a kindergartner at an elementary school located blocks from where the violence unfolded. 
Police say the three died in an apparent domestic dispute after a woman and two children were picked up by second woman who also had a child in her car. 
Police say a man rammed the car, then started shooting. He was found dead along with the woman and boy. 
Police have not released names or ages of those involved, but Jeff Haney of the Canyons School District confirmed to CBS affiliate KUTV Wednesday morning that the child who died was enrolled in kindergarten classes at nearby Brookwood Elementary in Sandy, Utah. 
Haney said the gunman also shot that student's brother, a fifth grader, who was taken into surgery Tuesday night. He had reconstructive surgery on his jaw, according to Haney, and will have to have at least one more surgery. 
The fifth-grader is in critical but stable condition. Haney said the boy was scheduled to participate in a fifth grade graduation ceremony Wednesday. 
Another young girl was shot, Haney said, and is in stable condition. She is not related to the woman, kindergartner or fifth-grader. 
Haney said Wednesday is Brookwood's last day of school before summer. 
Tracy Finau, who witnessed the shooting, told KUTV the shooter blocked the woman's car before shooting. 
""He walked out of his car, went to his passenger side, pulled out a handgun and walked toward the [woman's] car and shot the window out,"" Finau said. 
Finau said the shooter then walked around the vehicle and shot into the back windows.

Ridge Workman, a 14-year-old boy who lives several hundred yards away from the shooting, said he heard seven to eight gunshots but mistook them for fireworks. Workman said he saw a car in the street riddled with bullet holes. Its windows were smashed in and there was a lot of blood nearby, according to Workman. 
Resident Colby Corbett was in his backyard waiting for his 8-year-old son to walk home from school when he heard 20 to 30 gunshots within a few seconds. 
""I was panicking bad,"" Corbett said. ""I thought it was like a gun battle."" 
Corbett said he was relieved when his son arrived soon after, coming from the school and in the opposite direction of the gunfire. His son, Anthony, said he wasn't worried because he thought the gunshots were fireworks. 
The shooting occurred in the quiet neighborhood with winding roads, nestled against mountains about 20 miles southeast of Salt Lake City. 
It's about half a mile from an elementary school, but it was unclear if any children still at the school witnessed the shooting or heard gunshots, Canyons School District spokesman Jeff Haney said. 
School had let out for the afternoon but some students were still on the playground or talking outside with teachers when school officials were notified that the shooting had happened and the students and staff were hustled inside for a lockdown, Haney said. 
He said some parents arriving to pick up children realized what was happening and scooped up kids into their cars or ushered them into nearby homes. 
Parents and kids were being reunited Tuesday evening at the school, where the lockdown was lifted after about an hour. 
Teacher Janae Hunt said only a handful of kids were in the school when the lockdown was imposed and she didn't hear or see anything. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Eric Trump on Tuesday night said Democrats supporting the investigation into Russia and his father's campaign ""are not even people."" 
President Trump's son made the comments Tuesday night to Fox News' Sean Hannity, amid ongoing developments related to the FBI's Russia probe and fallout from the firing of FBI Director James Comey. Eric Trump also lashed out against Democrats more broadly, and called the head of the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez, a ""total whackjob."" 
""I've never seen hatred like this,"" Trump told Hannity, who said he agreed with the comments. ""And to me, they're not even people. It's so, so sad. I mean, morality's just gone. Morals have flown out the window. We deserve so much better than this as a country.""

The 33-year-old Trump is the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, responsible for managing his father's business dealings while Mr. Trump is president. He also campaigned for his father during the election, and he and his siblings have defended their father in the face of ongoing criticism of the White House. 
The White House is scrambling to manage and message the Russia-related developments, as Washington anticipates Comey's testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee Thursday. Comey is expected to testify about a conversation in which the president asked him to drop the FBI investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn left the White House in February less than a month into the job, after he misled Vice President Mike Pence about his interactions with the Russian ambassador. 
Ahead of Comey's testimony, the president announced in a tweet early Wednesday morning that he is nominating Christopher Wray , a former assistant attorney general in charge of the Department of Justice's Criminal Division, to take Comey's place as head of the FBI. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

MARGATE, England — Wearing a clerical collar and a leather jacket emblazoned with a flaming motorcycle, the Rev. Stuart Piper doesn't look like your typical right-wing candidate. 
He is a member of the U.K. Independence Party, known as UKIP, a party that spearheaded Britain's exit from the European Union . Its former leader, Nigel Farage, is a transatlantic ally of President Donald Trump. Rev. Stuart Piper Mo Abbas / NBC News 
""We get the same reaction to us that Donald Trump gets in the U.S.,"" he said of his own populist movement. 
""We're like Marmite — either you love it or you hate it,"" he added, referring to a British spread whose distinctive yeasty flavor has become a metaphor for anything that divides opinion in these isles. 
Thursday's British general election will offer a barometer of the strength of such feelings. The national vote will elect 650 lawmakers, with the party with the most seats likely forming the next government. 
Like Marmite, last year's shock decision to leave the EU — ""Brexit,"" as it's known — divided the country.

The referendum has remained a central issue in this election, which was hastily called by Prime Minister Theresa May just 50 days ago. She called on voters to strengthen her hand for what promise to be tough negotiations with the EU. 
But while politicians are still bickering over Brexit, a large number of voters in both the pro and anti-Brexit communities have moved on — something likely to hurt UKIP. Piper's party is fighting for its political life, even in Thanet, an area on the southeastern coast of Britain where it has previously enjoyed support. 
It was here, in the South Thanet voting district, that Trump's ally Farage ran and lost in the 2015 election — his last of seven unsuccessful attempts to enter Parliament. With Farage declining an eighth attempt, Piper is UKIP's candidate this time. Donald Trump and Nigel Farage. @nigelfarage / Twitter 
But he has a tough time convincing even those who might have been sympathetic last year. Although UKIP is promising to slash immigration and deliver tax cuts, to many voters they are seen as a single-issue party whose sole aim was achieved with Brexit. 
""It's history. UKIP only had one card and they've played it,"" said 50-year-old facilities manager Mark Rose, who was sat outside of a cafe in the tumbledown seaside resort of Margate. 
Around 60 miles east of central London, the town has struggled with unemployment and deprivation and is similar to U.S. rust belt towns that championed Trump . The town center of Margate, England. Mo Abbas / NBC News 
The wider district of Thanet voted 64 percent in favor of leaving the EU, but that doesn't appear to have translated into support for UKIP. The party's vote collapsed in local council elections held across the country last month. 
Rose said he voted for Brexit, but now the referendum is over he is now more concerned with national security. 
Fears like his have deepened for many Brits after their country was hit with a spate of three terror attacks in less than 11 weeks . The most recent of these occurred Saturday, when three men plowed a van through pedestrians on London Bridge before going on a stabbing rampage . 
""There's just no point in them anymore,"" Jean Parish, an 83-year-old retired nurse who also supported Brexit, told NBC News while out shopping just a short walk from Piper's office. Jean Parish Mo Abbas / NBC News 
The candidate takes hope from Farage's strong showing here in the 2015 election, coming in second behind the Conservatives. 
Since stepping away from front-line British politics, the former UKIP leader went on to carve himself a role in the U.S. as a cheerleader for Trump and a Fox News contributor. 
A large portrait of Farage features in Piper's office. 
""The Conservatives planted the idea that UKIP's job was done and the only way to see the country through was to vote Conservative,"" Piper said, also flanked by smaller portraits of Queen Elizabeth II and Winston Churchill. ""But we're not out of the EU yet. The job is not yet done."" 
He's not wrong. Brexit promises to be a protracted and difficult process that will last years. Much of the political discourse in Britain still revolves about what type of divorce settlement the country hopes to achieve. Flip-flopping 
The 28-member EU guarantees free movement of labor and access to a vast single market. These are principles that Brexiteers — people who voted Brexit — say has led to uncontrolled immigration and diminished sovereignty. 
The so-called ""Remainers"" who voted to stay, meanwhile, say it has increased prosperity and diversity. 
Formerly a Remainer, Prime Minister May gained power after the referendum and has since made Britain's split from the EU her central focus. She has drawn support away from UKIP by presenting herself as a ""strong and stable"" leader, able to deliver Brexit and reduce immigration — both key UKIP pledges. 
But she is facing a tough battle this week in a vote that was initially forecast to deliver her a landslide victory. 
She has been accused of flip-flopping after her office insisted at least half a dozen times that she wouldn't call an early election. May changed her mind while her center-right party enjoyed a 20-point lead in polls over the main opposition, the left-leaning Labour Party led by socialist Jeremy Corbyn .

That lead has shrunk to single digits in some polls after a series of policy reversals. May's reluctance to deviate from pre-prepared slogans and a refusal to participate in live TV debates has also led many commentators to summarize her campaign as having been badly run. 
""I was going to vote Conservative but she couldn’t even be bothered to turn up to the debate,"" said Georgina Kelk, 51, who is unemployed and on disability benefits. ""I think she got complacent and thought everyone would vote for her."" 
Kelk said she's now inclined to vote for Labour. 
Adding to Conservative woes, their manifesto contained a measure that would force some Britons to pay heavily toward elderly care — something they traditionally haven't done. This triggered an outcry among older voters, who tend to vote Conservative, and resulted in a hasty retreat by May.

""The British taught us in school to mind your body language, look people in the eye and be direct — a spoon is a spoon, a spade is a spade,"" said Elizabeth Asafu-Asdei, a 64-year-old care worker who was educated at a British school in Tanzania. 
""When I see Theresa May’s body language, I see a fearful woman, who says a cut is an increase and who calls an election when she said there wouldn't be one,"" Asafu-Asdei added. Enthusiasm 
While Conservatives appear to have floundered, Labour has confounded many pundits by surging in the polls — one of which Tuesday put them just one point behind the Conservatives. 
Many analysts have treated this with caution, however, citing other polls that give the Conservatives a bigger lead, as well as evidence Labour's vote-share may be increasing in areas it already holds, rather than key battlegrounds. 
On Brexit, the party has pledged to honor the referendum result but has signaled it plans to maintain closer ties with the EU than the Conservatives. 
Corbyn's party has also pledged to raise corporation tax and taxes for higher earners, a move that appeals to its blue-collar grassroots but which Conservatives say will harm the economy. 
But it's not just in Thanet where Labour's platform is catching people's attention. 
In Vauxhall, a diverse, inner-city London neighborhood across the Thames from the Houses of Parliament, 22-year-old student Joana Theresa was enthusiastic about the party's manifesto pledges. 
""The main thing that caught my eye is their support for young people in housing funding and student fees,"" she said. Charmaine Davis Mo Abbas / NBC News 
At a Jobcentre, where unemployed Britons receive welfare payments, 55-year-old Charmaine Davis said she probably would not vote but would choose Corbyn's party if she did. 
""If you do vote it’s going to take time for whoever gets in to correct the last government,"" Davis said, her speech labored and gait uneven having suffered two strokes. 
She hasn't worked for a year and has seen her welfare payments cut under the Conservatives. 
""But now I have a grandson it could be different because I won’t be here, but he will be and I want it to be better for him. That’s why I might vote."" 'S*** happens' 
Housing projects and luxury apartment blocks sit side-by-side in the ethnically diverse and rapidly gentrifying district of Vauxhall , which should be ripe for a pro-EU candidate given that 78 percent of voters there backed Remain. 
Hannah Renier, 71, said she plans to vote for the Liberal Democrats — a small pro-EU party that has pledged another Brexit referendum. It has poured campaign resources into Vauxhall to try to unseat incumbent Labour lawmaker Kate Hoey, who was a senior Brexiteer. George Turner Mo Abbas / NBC News 
""The vote here is about Brexit, but it's more than that,"" said Lib Dem candidate George Turner, whose campaign team that day included a pug dressed in a party T-shirt and rosette. ""It's about the failure of our member of parliament to adequately represent the views of her constituents on the most important issue of the day."" 
Yet stagnant results in opinion polls indicate his party's strategy may be stalling. 
Responding to Turner, Hoey told NBC News: ""The country is moving on from the referendum."" 
In Vauxhall, she may be right. 
""Sometimes we don’t get it our own way. S*** happens. So now it’s about trying to get the best deal rather than scupper any deal,"" 45-year-old bar manager Jason Douglas said. 
Retiree Chris Waite echoed his views: ""I voted Remain but now that we're leaving we'd better get on with it."" Mo Abbas",U.K. Election: Britain Heads to Ballot Box in Shadow of Brexit - NBC News,normal,6db1a47719e0fa518917ae16fc142ce83ffd6b01

The Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, the site of the Woodstock music festival in 1969, has been added to the National Register of Historic Places, according to an announcement on its website . The news was first reported by the Associated Press . 
Bethel Woods, which was a farm when half a million people trekked to upstate New York for the festival that created its legend, includes an 800-acre ""campus"" with a museum, a 15,000-seat amphitheater, a smaller gallery space and arts conservatory which opened in June 2008 following a $100 million investment. The onetime ""Aquarian Exposition"" now takes as its mission educating people on the ""issues and lessons"" of that turbulent decade which was both culminated and dispatched by that mid-August, rain-flecked, three-day celebration of peace and love. (For what it's worth, the next music event scheduled to take place there is a show from Train, O.A.R. and Natasha Bedingfield.) 
Being placed on the National Register requires meeting a fairly predictable set of criteria , and confers on spaces tax breaks for rehabilitation and special consideration for federal preservation money as well as federal construction projects. (You have to buy your own plaque , however.) 
The certification by the National Register comes on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the Summer of Love, the confluence of the hippie movement in San Francisco which cemented the countercultural wave in the minds of more mainstream observers that took place two years prior to Woodstock. (The Summer of Love and Woodstock were both inspired and presaged by the Monterey Pop Festival, held in June 1967, which featured many of the same artists as Woodstock on its lineup: Jimi Hendrix, The Who, The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and many others.) 
The Bethel Center's museum, for its part, is hosting an exhibition, ""Love For Sale,"" which examines commercialization of that counterculture, already well underway by the time the first chord was played at Woodstock. ""The counterculture was now everywhere,"" the museum writes , ""and Madison Avenue embraced the slogans, motifs, and attitudes of the movement to sell cars, soft drinks, fashion, and lifestyles to Main Street."" 
That co-option may have been fully predictable, if history was taken as a guide. ""What we kids didn't understand was that we were living in a commercial, commodity culture,"" the influential cartoonist R. Crumb, a quiet superstar of the '60s and creator of many indelible illustrations from the time, wrote in his autobiographical work The R. Crumb Handbook . ""Everything in our environment had been bought and sold. As middle-class Americans, we basically grew up on a movie set. The conscious values that are pushed are only part of the picture. The medium itself plays a much bigger part than anyone realizes: the creation of illusion. We are living surrounded by illusion, by professionally created fairy tales. We barely have contact with the real world.""",Site Of Woodstock Added To National Registry Of Historic Places : The Record : NPR,normal,13be6efe9d854fa2ec19f43f7478e6e599e6b85f

The verbal sparring became so intense that Committee Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, intervened at one point during a sharp exchange between California Democrat Kamala Harris and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. 
""The chair is going to exercise its right to allow the witnesses to answer the question, and committee is on notice to provide witnesses the courtesy, which has not been extended all the way across,"" Burr said. 
Republican John McCain of Arizona took a softer approach, drawing chuckles when he asked Coats, ""Do you want to tell us any more about the Russian involvement in our election that we don't already know from reading The Washington Post? "" 
Coats did not offer any details, but said, ""Just because it's in The Washington Post doesn't mean it's declassified."" 
The hearing brought four senior intelligence and law enforcement officials before the committee on Wednesday. In addition to Coats, Rogers and Rosenstein, Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe also testified. 
The hearing was highly anticipated because stories about the Russia investigation have emerged piecemeal, often based on anonymous sources. The intelligence chiefs are all key figures in the investigation, but have rarely spoken publicly, and not in one place, at one time, and under oath. 
However, the hearing offered relatively little new information, and shortly after it ended at midday, it was overtaken by the release of a statement by James Comey , the former FBI director who was fired by Trump on May 9. 
Comey is scheduled to testify before the committee on Thursday morning, and his prepared statement was posted on the committee's website. In the statement, Comey says Trump asked him for ""loyalty"" at a January dinner. Comey says the president also spoke to him about the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and said, ""I hope you can let this go."" 
The president has repeatedly called for an end to the various inquires swirling around his administration. But Democratic senators, in particular, want to know what he's told intelligence officials in private discussions. 
Trump reportedly asked Coats and Rogers to state publicly that there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Neither official has done so. 
Citing these reports, Warner said in his opening statement: 
""If any of this is true, it would be an appalling and improper use of our intelligence professionals — an act that could erode the public's confidence in our intelligence institutions. The (intelligence community) fiercely prides itself on its apolitical service to the country. Any attempt by the White House or even the president himself to exploit this community as a tool for political purposes is deeply, deeply troubling."" 
While Democrats have focused on possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, Republicans have focused on leaks about the investigation. ","Watch: In Senate Hearing, Intelligence Chiefs Won't Discuss Private Conversations With Trump : NPR",normal,03d7bf63a3629eea928027f3211a46a22fece3ca

A Massachusetts medical marijuana dispensary has created a new option for patients who don't want to smoke their dose of pot or eat it in the form of sweets : pot pizza. 
The cannabis-infused pizza has been on ""the menu"" for about three weeks at Ermont Inc., in Quincy, Massachusetts, a suburb south of Boston. And it's receiving rave reviews. 
""I've found that's the only thing that helps,"" patient Wes Francois told CBS Boston's Juli McDonald . 
""I want to stay away from painkillers. This is a great substitute for it. It's amazing how creative they get,"" Francois added. 
Ermont's director of operations, Seth Yaffe, said the company has a whole range of marijuana edibles, but he wanted to offer meals that patients could eat without a lot of sugar. 
The 6-inch cheese pizzas sell for $38 apiece. The tomato sauce contains 125 milligrams of tetrahydrocannabinol, referred to as THC, the psychoactive compound in marijuana. The company has sold about 200 pizzas already.

Ermont has been open since October and integrates all phases of production including a lab, marijuana growing areas, retail space and a kitchen. 
Using years of experience in Boston restaurants, team members are constantly looking for new ways to infuse flavorless liquid cannabinoids into ingredients and sauces. Their edible menu helps make life more normal for patients in pain.

House Speaker Paul Ryan appeared to forget the capital of Turkey in a Tuesday evening tweet -- incorrectly calling on Istanbul to take responsibility for an attack on protesters at the Turkish embassy last month, rather than Ankara. 
The Wisconsin Republican's error showed up in a warning statement to Turkey Tuesday issued after the House voted unanimously to condemn the violent attack against protesters outside the Turkish ambassador's residence a few weeks ago. 
""The blame for assault lies with the Turkish government alone,"" Ryan wrote. ""I urge Instanbul to finally accept responsibility for this egregious incident and apologize.""

Ryan's communications director, Michael Ricci, told CBS News that he was responsible for the error. He said it was an ""honest mistake,"" and he regretted the mix-up. Ricci posted a corrected Tweet Wednesday afternoon. Ryan's web site currently features the amended statement, which now reads ""Ankara"" in place of Istanbul. That statement was updated Tuesday evening following the vote.

This is ""not a great time"" at the FBI, as the bureau pushes ahead with a ""hole"" created by the firing of FBI Director James Comey, a law enforcement source told CBS News. 
Comey's firing, which discouraged many in the FBI, came in the midst of one of the most important investigations in its history, as it digs into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and whether President Trump's campaign associates colluded with the Russians. The hope is that Mr. Trump's pick for FBI director, Christopher Wray, will once again bring some stability to the bureau. 
When Wray's name first surfaced as a potential candidate during a White House press briefing last week, employees in the FBI expressed some relief that the president might not be selecting an elected official, according to the source. Democrats, in particular, expressed concern when former Sen. Joe Lieberman was floated as a top contender. But given Mr. Trump's reported expectations of Comey and a conversation in which the president reportedly asked Comey to drop an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, sources tell CBS News there are concerns within the FBI about whether Wray's loyalty will be to the president or to the FBI and its mission.

SANDY , Utah -- Utah school officials say a boy killed in a Tuesday afternoon shooting that also left two adults dead was a kindergartner at an elementary school located blocks from where the violence unfolded.
Police say the three died in an apparent domestic dispute after a woman and two children were picked up by second woman who also had a child in her car.
Police say a man rammed the car, then started shooting. He was found dead along with the woman and boy.
Police have not released names or ages of those involved, but Jeff Haney of the Canyons School District confirmed to CBS affiliate KUTV Wednesday morning that the child who died was enrolled in kindergarten classes at nearby Brookwood Elementary in Sandy, Utah.
Haney said the gunman also shot that student's brother, a fifth grader, who was taken into surgery Tuesday night. He had reconstructive surgery on his jaw, according to Haney, and will have to have at least one more surgery.
The fifth-grader is in critical but stable condition. Haney said the boy was scheduled to participate in a fifth grade graduation ceremony Wednesday.
Another young girl was shot, Haney said, and is in stable condition. She is not related to the woman, kindergartner or fifth-grader.
Haney said Wednesday is Brookwood's last day of school before summer.
Tracy Finau, who witnessed the shooting, told KUTV the shooter blocked the woman's car before shooting.
""He walked out of his car, went to his passenger side, pulled out a handgun and walked toward the [woman's] car and shot the window out,"" Finau said.
Finau said the shooter then walked around the vehicle and shot into the back windows.

Posted by KUTV 2News on Tuesday, June 6, 2017 Ridge Workman, a 14-year-old boy who lives several hundred yards away from the shooting, said he heard seven to eight gunshots but mistook them for fireworks. Workman said he saw a car in the street riddled with bullet holes. Its windows were smashed in and there was a lot of blood nearby, according to Workman.
Resident Colby Corbett was in his backyard waiting for his 8-year-old son to walk home from school when he heard 20 to 30 gunshots within a few seconds.
""I was panicking bad,"" Corbett said. ""I thought it was like a gun battle.""
Corbett said he was relieved when his son arrived soon after, coming from the school and in the opposite direction of the gunfire. His son, Anthony, said he wasn't worried because he thought the gunshots were fireworks.
The shooting occurred in the quiet neighborhood with winding roads, nestled against mountains about 20 miles southeast of Salt Lake City.
It's about half a mile from an elementary school, but it was unclear if any children still at the school witnessed the shooting or heard gunshots, Canyons School District spokesman Jeff Haney said.
School had let out for the afternoon but some students were still on the playground or talking outside with teachers when school officials were notified that the shooting had happened and the students and staff were hustled inside for a lockdown, Haney said.
He said some parents arriving to pick up children realized what was happening and scooped up kids into their cars or ushered them into nearby homes.
Parents and kids were being reunited Tuesday evening at the school, where the lockdown was lifted after about an hour.
Teacher Janae Hunt said only a handful of kids were in the school when the lockdown was imposed and she didn't hear or see anything.","Sandy, Utah shooting victims include kindergartner, two adults",normal,a86c521f82c5df0a7d42c0b5959392164e58eb39

Being a ""dork"" may not be a title most people embrace, but the Russell family has turned that into a hugely profitable business. 
Rachel Renée Russell is the author of the hit graphic novels, ""Dork Diaries,"" which follow the life of an awkward teenage girl named Nikki Maxwell as she muddles her way through middle school. 
""The Misadventures of Max Crumbly: Middle School Mayhem"" Simon & Schuster 
More than 36 million copies are in print in 37 different languages. 
Russell's daughters, Erin and Nikki, helped inspire the novels and also contribute by co-writing and illustrating the books. 
Now, the team is out with a new book for their ""Max Crumbly"" series called ""The Misadventures of Max Crumbly: Middle School Mayhem."" It's about a gawky teenage boy with superhero ambitions. 
The three joined ""CBS This Morning"" to discuss the second book in the ""Max Crumbly"" series and what it's like to collaborate as a family. 
""With Max Crumbly and with Nikki Maxwell, they're both really dorky outsiders and so I do draw on my childhood for that,"" said Erin, who writes along with her mom. 
On why being dorky is good, Erin said, ""Dorks are underestimated and misunderstood because they think uniquely and they do their own thing, but really, it's good to be that way. It's good to be independent and to embrace your unique.""","The ""Dork Diaries"" series is a family affair",normal,aa7d9c131304cb72d148580dad8e02f2b5e5419a

ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Bullets fired by an officer who killed a black motorist last July came close to the motorist's girlfriend and her young daughter, who were in the car, a lab supervisor at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension testified Wednesday. 
Lindsey Garfield testified in the trial of St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez, who is charged with manslaughter in the death of Philando Castile . Yanez shot Castile during a traffic stop in a St. Paul suburb in July. Yanez, 29, is also charged with two counts of intentional discharge of a firearm for endangering Castile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds , and Reynolds' then-4-year-old daughter. 
Yanez and another officer had stopped Castile over a broken taillight when the 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker informed Yanez he was carrying a gun. Within seconds, Yanez fired seven shots and Castile was mortally wounded. 
The shooting gained attention when Reynolds began livestreaming its aftermath on Facebook . Prosecutors say Yanez acted unreasonably, but the defense says he had to make a split-second decision to protect himself.

PORTLAND, Ore. -- The man accused of killing two men and wounding a third who tried to stop his anti-Muslim tirade against two teenagers on a Portland, Oregon, light-rail train shouted he was ""not guilty"" Wednesday during a courtroom outburst directed at one of the victims. 
Jeremy Christian, 35, didn't enter a plea during his brief court appearance but said he was ""not guilty of anything but defending myself against the violent aggression by Micah Fletcher !"" Portland stabbing survivor says city has ""white savior complex"" 
Fletcher was in the courtroom but said nothing to reporters and displayed no reaction as he left with his father. The 21-year-old was stabbed in the neck during the May 26 attack that killed Ricky Best and Taliesin Namkai-Meche .

The stabbings shocked the liberal city and deepened worries about a series of apparent hate crimes in the region and contentious public rallies that have drawn national attention. 
Prosecutors who have reviewed videos and interviews with witnesses say in court papers that Christian yelled hateful comments at two black girls, one of whom was wearing an Islamic head covering called a hijab. 
When the girls moved away from Christian, he made a sudden move toward Namkai-Meche. The two got into a confrontation, prompting Fletcher to stand up. 
Christian shoved Fletcher in the chest and then pulled out a knife that he concealed in his right hand, prosecutor Ryan Lufkin wrote. Fletcher pushed Christian back, causing him to stumble. 
Christian asked Fletcher to ""Hit me again!"" as Fletcher kept telling him to get off the train. Christian then stabbed Fletcher, Namkai-Meche and a third man who intervened, Best. 
Christian was arraigned Wednesday in a 15-count indictment charging him with aggravated murder, attempted murder and other crimes. The hearing lasted about two minutes, and he's due in court again July 18. 
He is being held without bail at a jail in downtown Portland. 
Court officials made the hearing earlier and banned livestreaming in an effort to avoid the chaos that erupted at Christian's first court appearance. 
Last week, Christian shouted, "" You call it terrorism; I call it patriotism! "" and spectators watching a video feed in the hallway because they could not get a seat nearly brawled with one of the suspect's supporters before turning their anger against sheriff's deputies. 
Four charges in Christian's indictment stem from a confrontation Christian had with a black woman at a light-rail station a day before the killings. He hit her in the face with a bottle before she pepper-sprayed him, Portland police Sgt. Pete Simpson said.

One of Fletcher's professors, Joel Bluestone, told KOIN he is not surprised Fletcher stood up to help.
""He did it because it's just the right thing to do and he's just that type of person. I mean, two teenage girls are getting harassed. You just step up. It's the right thing to do,"" he said. ""He's that type of person, definitely, 120 percent that type of person.""
Fellow student Josh Gianola also said he wasn't surprised about what Fletcher did.
""It's amazing and I think what everyone hopes that they would do in a situation like that, and he did it,"" Gianola told KOIN. ""It's not surprising that he would stand up to hate in such a way. Of course, its devastating that that's how it turned out but it's not a surprise that he would stand up like that.""
Fletcher's wound was within millimeters of being fatal, court documents say. He has been released from the hospital and attended both of Christian's court hearings, where a scar on his neck was visible.

Jomo K. Johnson, pastor and co-founder of Black Lives Matter Savannah , began his hunger strike on June 6, the one year anniversary of the death of Kalief Browder, a teen who spent nearly three years in solitary confinement and later committed suicide .
Drinking only water for a minimum of 30 days, Johnson will post an update and encouraging message on Facebook each night. He says he will end the hunger strike when he feels enough awareness has been raised or his body forces him to yield.
“We want to give more attention to mental health—especially those coming out of prison and [the] LGBTQ community. I believed this was a method to talk about death on a regular basis,” said Johnson.
According to the American Association of Suicidology, 2,023 black men died from suicide in 2015 , and Johnson says that number is on the rise. The organization also reports that in 2014 suicide among male Black youth ages 10-19 was nearly three times higher than that of female Black youth ages 10-19. The organization includes homelessness, social isolation, and substance abuse in a list of factors that put Blacks at risk of suicide.
Johnson helped co-found the BLM group in 2016 following the shooting deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile to educate citizens and speak out in social injustices taking place in Savannah. Through vigils and community meetings, the group has been working to shed light on policing reform and mental health issues within the Black community.
Post by NBC News . His hunger strike also comes nearly a month after the death of Ferguson protester Edward Crawford , who also allegedly committed suicide. Johnson says that activists are “bearing a double burden” and if one doesn’t talk about their own struggle while trying to help others it can lead them to make a drastic decision such as suicide.
“It’s hard enough to care for the movement when it’s hard enough to care for ourselves. Often times those who are the greatest activists are those who are the greatest persecuted,” Johnson said. “We still have to worry about how we’re going to take care of ourselves, how we’re going to put food on the table, and deal with things that have been done to us but yet we’re trying to move a movement forward.”

Browder’s death hits close to home for Johnson, as he also has battled depression and attempted suicide. He connects suicide and religion in his book, “ Conversations With Jesus Before and After Suicide ,"" where he makes the argument that the religious belief that suicide is a sin is false, calling it “absolutely wrong” for one to say that those who committed suicide — like 8-year-old Gabriel Taye — have sinned.
“There's no place in scripture where it condemns the taking of one’s life. The taking of one’s life is an unfortunate consequence of us living in a world that is broken,” Johnson said. “I think it’s important for the church to recognize that what they’ve been teaching is not true and they need to acknowledge that and try to adjust so that people won’t be hurt by these wrongful teachings.”
Johnson says American churches don’t fully understand mental illnesses and most want to “either heal it instantly or say it’s from the devil.”
But in order for healing to begin, Johnson feels that suffering from mental illness must be accepted.
“Some people will suffer from mental illness for the rest of their lives, some people will suffer from suicidal thoughts for the rest of their lives. But that doesn’t make them different, it makes them human,” Johnson said. “We need to embrace those who are suffering from it, allow them to verbalize their pain, their struggle - and then ultimately seek to encourage and connect with those who are suffering so that they know they have someone they can talk to.”

Johnson went through deep depression in 2016 and even prayed asking God to take his life. He says he thinks about suicide everyday, but that grace and faith in God gives him the strength to keep going. He hopes his hunger strike will not only bring awareness but empower people to listen.
“If someone tells you they’re suffering from suicidal thoughts or depression, give them your phone number. There are so many people that just need to be heard and want people to listen to them. If we can be a listening ear, we can prevent many of these suicides that are going on in the world.”

TEHRAN, Iran -- An Iranian security official says the assailants in deadly attacks on Iran's parliament and the shrine of its revolutionary leader Wednesday were Iranian nationals.
The website of independent Shargh daily Quote: d Reza Seifollahi, an official in the country's Supreme National Security Council, as saying the operatives in the dual attacks in Tehran that killed at least 12 people were from Iran. He did not elaborate.
Tehran Police Chief Gen. Hossein Sajedinia announced late Wednesday night that five suspects had been detained for interrogation, according to a report in the semi-official ISNA news agency. Sajedinia did not offer any further details.
One of the suspects is said to be a woman, CBS News' Mark Phillips reports.
The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) group has claimed responsibility for the attacks. This is believed to be the first time ISIS has struck in Iran.

The bloodshed shocked the country and came as emboldened Sunni Arab states -- backed by U.S. President Trump -- are hardening their stance against Shiite-ruled Iran.
The White House released a statement from Mr. Trump condemning the terrorist attacks in Tehran and offering condolences, but also implying that Iran is itself a sponsor of terrorism.
""We grieve and pray for the innocent victims of the terrorist attacks in Iran, and for the Iranian people, who are going through such challenging times,"" the statement said. ""We underscore that states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote.""
A U.S. State Department spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, says the U.S. is sending thoughts and prayers to the Iranian people following the attacks. Nauert says the U.S. is expressing condolences to the victims and their families.
A child is rescued during and attack on Iran's parliament building.
FARS NEWS Nauert says that ""the depravity of terrorism has no place in a peaceful, civilized world.""
In recent years, Tehran has been heavily involved in conflicts in Syria and Iraq against the Islamic State, but had remained untouched by ISIS violence around the world. Iran has also battled Saudi-backed Sunni groups in both countries.
Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard indirectly blamed Saudi Arabia for the attacks. A statement issued Wednesday evening stopped short of alleging direct Saudi involvement but called it ""meaningful"" that the attacks followed Mr. Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia , where he strongly asserted Washington's support for Riyadh.
The statement said Saudi Arabia ""constantly supports"" terrorists including ISIS, adding that the group's claim of responsibility ""reveals (Saudi Arabia's) hand in this barbaric action.""
The ""spilled blood of the innocent will not remain unavenged,"" the Revolutionary Guard statement said.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's supreme leader, used the attacks to defend Tehran's involvement in wars abroad. He told a group of students that if ""Iran had not resisted,"" it would have faced even more troubles.
""The Iranian nation will go forward,"" he added.
The violence began in midmorning when assailants with Kalashnikov rifles and explosives stormed the parliament complex where a legislative session had been in progress. The siege lasted for hours, and one of the attackers blew himself up inside, according to Iran's state TV. Iranian sources told CBS News' Mark Phillips that it took five hours for the attackers to be killed.
The locations were chosen for maximum exposure and symbolic values, Phillips reports.
Images circulating in Iranian media showed gunmen held rifles near the windows of the complex. One showed a toddler being handed through a first-floor window to safety outside as an armed man looks on.
ISIS' Aamaq news agency released a 24-second video purportedly shot inside the complex, showing a bloody, lifeless body on the floor next to a desk.
An Associated Press reporter saw several police snipers on the roofs of nearby buildings. Police helicopters circled the parliament and all mobile phone lines from inside were disconnected.
Shops in the area were closed as gunfire rang out and officials urged people to avoid public transportation. Witnesses said the attackers fired from the parliament building's fourth floor at people in the streets.
""I was passing by one of the streets. I thought that children were playing with fireworks, but I realized people are hiding and lying down on the streets,"" Ebrahim Ghanimi, who was around the parliament building, told the AP. ""With the help of a taxi driver, I reached a nearby alley.""
As the parliament attack unfolded, gunmen and suicide bombers also struck outside Khomeini's mausoleum on Tehran's southern outskirts. Khomeini led the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the Western-backed shah to become Iran's first supreme leader until his death in 1989.
Iran's state broadcaster said a security guard was killed at the tomb and that one of the attackers was slain by security guards. A woman was also arrested. The revered shrine was not damaged.
The Interior Ministry said six assailants were killed - four at the parliament and two at the tomb. A senior Interior Ministry official told Iran's state TV the male attackers wore women's attire.
Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani called the attacks a cowardly act.
Saudi Arabia and Iran regularly accuse each other of supporting extremists in the region. Saudi Arabia has long pointed to the absence of IS attacks in Iran as a sign of Tehran's culpability. For its part, Iran has cited Saudi Arabia's support for jihadists and its backing of hard-line Sunni fighters in Syria.
Mr. Trump's first overseas visit to Saudi Arabia last month positioned the U.S. firmly on the side of the kingdom and other Arab states in their stance against Iran. His assurances of Washington's support emboldened hawkish royals Mr. in Saudi Arabia, which is at war in Yemen against Iranian-allied rebels.
The attacks are likely to deepen enmity and sharpen the regional battle for power between the two rivals. Tensions are running high this week following a cut in ties between key Arab powers and Qatar over accusations that the energy-rich nation supports terrorist groups and is aligning itself too closely with Iran.
Saudi Arabia has been a target of numerous lethal attacks by IS affiliates who see the kingdom's Western-allied leadership as heretics. The group has also targeted Shiites in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. IS militants are fighting Iranian-backed forces in Syria and Iraq, and they view Shiites as apostates.
Nelly Lahoud, an expert on extremism at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain, said IS leaders may be looking to rally supporters through the attacks in Iran as they lose ground in Syria and Iraq.
""Now that they are unable to maintain the promise of territory, attacking Iran is to their advantage,"" she said. ""It wouldn't surprise me if this were planned for a long time.""
On March 27, the ISIS posted a 37-minute video in Farsi threatening Iran. The Clarion Project said the speakers claimed to represent various Iranian Sunni ethnic groups, such as the Baluchis and Ahvazis, and encouraged Iranian Sunnis to join the group.
Wednesday's attacks, during the holy month of Ramadan that is observed by both Sunni and Shiite Muslims, came as ISIS is competing with al-Qaida for jihadi recruits.
Arab separatists are active in Iran's southern city of Ahvaz, where they killed two policemen three weeks ago. Though most Iranians are Shiite, including separatists in Ahvaz, the eastern Baloch region is majority Sunni, although there are no recent census figures available. There is also a significant Sunni population in southern Hormozgan province.
The attacks drew condemnation from Iran's allies -- and also from the United States. That was notable because of the deep distrust between Tehran and Washington, which don't have diplomatic relations.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the U.S. expressed condolences to the victims and their families.
""The depravity of terrorism has no place in a peaceful, civilized world,"" Nauert said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin sent condolences and confirmed Moscow's willingness to aid its ally. Syria's Foreign Ministry also condemned the attacks, which it said were backed by various governments that it did not specify.
The IS group often claims attacks around the world, even when links to the group cannot be confirmed. Iranian security officials have not said who might have been behind the attacks, although state media called the assailants ""terrorists.""
There are concerns that a doubling down on security could lead to a wider clampdown on the opposition in Iran. Rights group Amnesty International urged Iranian authorities to carry out impartial investigations into the attacks.
Charlie Winter, a senior research fellow at King's College London, said the attacks could provoke a disproportionate counterterrorism response in Iran.
""Iranian officials will be called upon to step up intervention in Iraq (and) Syria big time,"" he said, adding that Wednesday's attacks will significantly boost IS morale amid battlefield defeats","Suspects in Tehran attacks were Iranian, official says - CBS News",normal,8dcda2749dae8974d188fac00a74ba94441070e3

LOUIS -- Police in Illinois believe the remains of a child found in the garage of a vacant home had been there four years and are investigating the death as a homicide.
The remains were wrapped in two blankets, the St. Clair County coroner Calvin Dye Sr. told CBS affiliate KLAS-TV . The body found was so badly decomposed, authorities couldn't immediately determine the gender.   
Officers found the remains Tuesday morning after a woman in Las Vegas contacted police and told officers her husband had killed their then-6-year-old daughter in Illinois years earlier and hid the body in the garage of a home in Centreville, near St. Louis. She also said her husband, identified by police as Jason Quate, 34, forced her into sex trafficking over the past two years and had abused two other children. 
Las Vegas police shared the tip with Centreville police, who found the small body inside the detached garage behind a dilapidated and vacant home in the impoverished town of about 6,000 residents. 
Jason Quate
KMOV-TV Authorities suspect the child was killed in nearby Belleville in 2013 and taken to the Centreville garage. An autopsy is expected later this week, Dye said. 
The girl's mother contacted police from a woman's shelter, where she said she had gone to seek refuge from her husband. She said Quate killed the child during a ""physical altercation,"" Las Vegas police Lt. Raymond Spencer said in a video statement. 
Spencer said officers were told the woman's remaining children, who are in their early teens, were never allowed outside, even to attend school. He described them as pale and lacking socialization skills, and said officers observed signs of abuse. Both children were taken into protective custody. 
""It was very disturbing when you saw the children,"" Spencer said. 
Belleville detectives were sent to Las Vegas to work on the case, while others focused Wednesday on a Belleville home, Master Sgt. Todd Keilbach said Wednesday. Real estate records obtained by the Associated Press show Quate lived in the Belleville home that was being examined. 
There are no records indicating that Quate ever lived at the home in Centreville. 
Quate is jailed in Las Vegas. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said he expected to file charges of felony sex trafficking and living off the earnings of a prostitute Wednesday against Quate. 
Wolfson said the woman also is under investigation. 
""We're looking at the behavior of both of them for potential criminal charges,"" Wolfson said. 
Any charges related to the girl's death would be filed in Illinois. St. Clair County State's Attorney Brendan Kelly said the investigation was still ongoing and declined further comment. 
Court records show that a man with the same name and birth date as Quate was convicted of three crimes in Belleville. He was sentenced to probation for two residential burglaries in July 2000 and was convicted of misdemeanor retail theft in May 2000. 
Neighbors told the Belleville News-Democrat that the small house in Centreville with boarded-up windows has been vacant for more than two years.

The study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that for each cup of non-cow's milk children drank per day, they were 0.4 centimeters shorter than the average for their age. Conversely, for each daily cup of cow's milk they drank, children were 0.2 centimeters taller than average.
For a 3-year-old, the height difference for those drinking three cups of non-cow's milk compared to three cups of cow's milk per day was 1.5 centimeters.
Height is an important indicator of a child's overall health, the authors note, and cow's milk is a reliable source of dietary protein and fat, essential for proper growth in early childhood.

But there's been a shift in recent years to milk alternatives , which are often marketed as healthier options.
""Many parents are choosing non-cow's milk beverages like soy and almond milk because of perceived health benefits,"" the authors write in the report. ""However, non-cow's milk contains less protein and fat than cow's milk and may not have the same effect on height.""
What's more, lead study author Dr. Jonathon Maguire, a pediatrician at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, notes that while the nutritional content of cow's milk is regulated in the United States and Canada, the nutritional contents of most non-cow's milks are not.
""The lack of regulation means the nutritional content varies widely from one non-cow's milk product to the next, particularly in the amount of protein and fat,"" he said in a statement.

For the study, the researchers examined the dietary habits of more than 5,000 children between the ages of 1 and 3. Parents were asked how many cups of cow's milk and non-cow's milk their child drank on a typical day.
Ninety-two percent said their child drank cow's milk daily, while 13 percent drank non-cow's milk.
The study is limited in a number of ways, most importantly in that it is observational and cannot prove that drinking one type of milk over the other causes an increase or decrease in a child's height.
Additionally, while the researchers took a number of potential other factors into account, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), maternal ethnicity, income, and the mother's height, they did not ask about the specific type of cow's milk alternative, or about the child's overall diet.
Both of these are big gaps in the research, says Erin Corrigan, a registered dietitian at Nicklaus Children's Hospital, in Miami.

""We don't know why kids were drinking non-cow's milk,"" she told HealthDay. ""We don't know whether the family was vegetarian or vegan, for instance.""
Overall diet might have been lacking in at least some of the cases, Corrigan says. She says vegetarian diets can be healthy for young children – though vegan diets are trickier.
""It depends on the child and their acceptance of the diet,"" Corrigan told HealthDay. ""There's a difference between a child who's only eating bagels and pasta, and a child who's eating a variety of foods like quinoa, legumes, tempeh and avocados .""
The study does not argue that cow's milk is necessary for proper growth in kids. Still, Maguire says parents shouldn't assume milk alternatives are ""healthier"" than cow's milk – no matter what the advertising claims.
 ""If products are being marketed as being equivalent to cow's milk, as a consumer and a parent, I would like to know that they are in fact the same in terms of their effect on children's growth,"" he said.","""Growing"" concern about non-cow's milk for kids",normal,0ee2a7dfd22b6ee0e3897e5aa3eddbd78cf8ad6e

President Trump's lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, welcomed fired FBI Director James Comey's account of his conversations with President Trump, saying in a statement that Mr. Trump ""is pleased that Mr. Comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the President was not under investigation in any Russia probe.""
The statement goes on to say that the president ""feels completely and totally vindicated,"" and that ""he is eager to continue to move forward with his agenda.""
On Wednesday, the eve of former FBI Director James Comey's public testimony about his conversations with President Trump, the Senate Intelligence Committee released his seven-page opening statement , at Comey's request. Comey is expected to say Thursday that President Trump asked him to ""lift the cloud"" over him and the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.

Comey's statement reveals key details about his nine interactions in person and on the phone with Mr. Trump. Comey wrote memos about each of those interactions, the first of which was in January.
In his prepared testimony, the former FBI director confirmed earlier reports that Mr. Trump asked that Comey drop the FBI's investigation into former National Security Adviser Gen. Michael Flynn , a day after his resignation, and Comey also confirmed that the president requested a pledge of loyalty . However, Comey also acknowledged in his statement that he did inform the president that he was personally not the subject of an investigation, a point that Mr. Trump made in Comey's termination letter in May.

NEW YORK -- More than two dozen members of a Russian organized criminal group have been charged with committing several offenses, including trafficking 10,000 pounds of stolen chocolate across the country, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced Wednesday. 
According to federal court papers , the FBI's Joint Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force arrested 27 members of the New York City-based group -- called the Shulaya Enterprise -- on suspicion of racketeering, wire and credit card fraud, narcotics trafficking, firearms and stolen property offenses. The defendants also face charges of extortion, gambling and identity theft. 
""The suspects in this case cast a wide net of criminal activity, aiming to make as much money as possible,"" FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney said. ""The dizzying array of criminal schemes committed against this organized crime syndicate allegedly include a murder-for-hire conspiracy, a plot to rob victims by seducing and drugging them with chloroform and a fraud on casino slot machines using electronic hacking devices."" 
Authorities say the group operated under the direction and protection of two men, named Razhden Shulaya and Zurab Dzhanashvili. At this time, authorities are searching for additional suspects who remain at large. 
The complaint states the Shulaya Enterprise operated out of New York, New Jersey, Florida, Pennsylvania, Nevada and other locations overseas. Many of the group members were born in the former Soviet Union, but authorities believe they regularly visited and communicated with associates in Georgia, the Ukraine and the Russian Federation. 
If convicted as charged, each defendant could face decades in prison for some of the charges. 
The suspects were expected to appear in federal court on Wednesday. It remains unclear when their next court appearance will be held. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. ","Russian mobsters trafficked 10,000 pounds of chocolate: feds",normal,53eabe5e934510be162b99674a123df9791f7d2b

In a phone call with Qatar's ruling emir, Sheikh Tamin bin Hamad Al Thani, Mr. Trump said he wanted to help Qatar and its Arab neighbors resolve the row that has upended any sense of Gulf unity, suggesting a possible White House summit among leaders. Though Mr. Trump again said countries must eliminate funding streams for terror groups, the White House said he focused on the need for the region's various U.S. allies to stick together. 
Blockaded by its neighbors by land and sea, Qatar is eager for Trump's help. Qatar's U.S. ambassador, Meshal bin Hamad Al Thani, told The Associated Press his country is counting on Washington to persuade Saudi Arabia and others to back down. 
""We have great confidence in the president's ability to calm this crisis and to resolve it,"" Al Thani said in an interview. 
Mr. Trump's bid to fashion himself as a neutral arbiter among Arab governments departed from his stance only a day earlier, when he left little doubt about where he felt the fault rested. In a tweetstorm , Mr. Trump said Mideast leaders he'd met with last month had all ""pointed to Qatar"" as the source of terrorist financing.
During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!

Mr. Trump continued tweeting, saying his visit to the region was ""already paying off"" and that ""perhaps this will be the beginning of the end of the horror of terrorism.
...extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2017 Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates joined the Saudis earlier this week in cutting diplomatic ties to Qatar , accusing it of backing groups from al-Qaida and Hamas to the Muslim Brotherhood that threaten the region's other governments. Qatar vehemently denies such support. Al Thani, the ambassador, insisted his country had no idea why Qatar's neighbors were picking a fight.   
Qatar received no notice from the other Arab countries before ties were cut, he said, calling it ""a surprise and a shock to us, this act of aggression."" He said normal life in Qatar is ""not affected"" by the blockage, insisting the tiny country maintains sufficient access to other air and sea routes to secure food for its people. 
Mr. Trump's broadside Tuesday against Qatar, which plays a major role in U.S. military efforts in the Mideast, arrived as an early-morning shock to U.S. officials. They then sought to clean up the president's comments by stressing U.S.-Qatari cooperation remained intact and crediting the country with working hard to stem funding and support for extremists. 
That was enough, it seemed, to persuade Qatar the U.S. wasn't abandoning its strategic partner. 
""We don't see that he's pointing fingers at Qatar,"" Al Thani said. ""Our relationship with the U.S. speaks for itself."" 
Countries across the globe are increasingly faced with the same conundrum: How much credence to give to the president's Twitter musings when they deviate sharply from U.S. policy?

Emirati officials said they perceived Mr. Trump's tweets as a sign Qatar shouldn't count on America taking its side despite U.S. having some 10,000 troops based in the country's al-Udeid Air Base. 
But in Germany, Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer pointed out that Mr. Trump's words differed substantially from those of State Department and Pentagon officials. 
""I can indeed see differences in some 140 character comments by the American president,"" Schaefer said. ""But what the position of the United States of America... is something I can't really say."" 
Both Qatar and the U.S. sought to show the rift wasn't affecting military cooperation . They cited no change to the status of al-Udeid Air Base. And a State Department official said an approved but pending sale of F-15 fighter planes to Qatar hasn't been affected. 
The call with Qatar's emir showed Mr. Trump trying to personally involve himself in resolving the conflict. A day earlier, Mr. Trump discussed the crisis with King Salman of Saudi Arabia, which is leading the anti-Qatar campaign. 
Other countries also are offering to intervene, and it's not clear if Mr. Trump will end up as the primary mediator. Kuwait's emir flew to the UAE on Wednesday to discuss the crisis, while Qatari ally Turkey voiced willingness to play a role.

A White House summit seemed an unlikely possibility. The potential for a coup makes it unlikely the Qatari emir would travel so far from home, especially as its adversaries hint that regime change would be welcome. 
In the interview, Al Thani confirmed the FBI is helping Qatar investigate a hack of its state-run news agency last month that may have been a catalyst for the crisis. The Saudis and others have cited an article in which a top Qatari official seemed to pay tribute to Iran as a major regional power; the Qataris say the comments were fabricated as part of the hack. 
Al Thani also denied any Qatari involvement in a separate hack of emails belonging to the UAE's Washington ambassador, which have surfaced at various news agencies this week.",Trump offers to broker resolution to Gulf diplomatic crisis,normal,086bac329e77bdca7da082c1d360985820371961

His detention did not appear to be linked to his work with Amnesty International and the organization was not believed to be specifically targeted in the police sweep, the rights group said. Amnesty said it was not clear why Kilic was suspected of having ties to Gulen's movement. 
Amnesty Secretary General Salil Shetty said the detention of Kilic and 22 other lawyers was proof of ""how arbitrary"" Turkey's crackdown on the Gulen movement has become. 
Play Video 60 Minutes Overtime Who is Fethullah Gulen? Turkish President Erdogan says the exiled cleric is responsible for this summer's coup. In 2012, 60 Minutes examined why Gulen is in the U.S. 
""In the absence of credible and admissible evidence of their involvement in internationally recognized crimes, we are calling on the Turkish authorities to immediately release Taner Kilic along with the other 22 lawyers,"" said Shetty. 
There was no immediate comment from the Turkish authorities on Kilic's case. But in Washington, the State Department said the United States was ""deeply concerned"" about the detention, calling it part of ""an alarming trend."" 
""As we have expressed to the Turkish government on numerous occasions, persistent curbs on free speech and other freedoms erode the foundations of democratic society,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. 
Turkey has launched a widespread crackdown on Gulen's followers since the July 15, 2016, coup attempt, arresting some 50,000 people and purging tens of thousands of others from government jobs. On Wednesday, authorities issued warrants for the detention of eight former and current employees of Turkey's defense company, ASELSAN, suspected of ties to Gulen's movement, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. 
Critics say the government is using a state of emergency declared after the attempted coup to clamp down on all opponents. 
In November 2016, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Gulen a ""leader of a terrorist organization,"" on "" 60 Minutes ."" Erdogan insisted the crackdown since the coup is not targeting a political movement.
""In Turkey, they attempted to destroy my state,"" Erdogan said. ""And of course, we could not remain silent. We could not remain indifferent. And these measures are being taken by prosecutors and judges in full accordance with the rule of law.

Reality Leigh Winner, 25, a government contractor who worked with the National Security Agency, has been charged with providing the ""top secret"" document to online news outlet The Intercept.
""My client is innocent until proven guilty and we plan to enter a plea of not guilty,"" attorney Titus Nichols told NBC News Wednesday afternoon.
Winner remains in a county jail in Lincoln County, Georgia, while she awaits a detention hearing on Thursday, officials said. The jail released Winner’s booking photo to NBC affiliate WRDW and NBC News earlier Wednesday.
Winner was booked Saturday at around 8 p.m., according to her arrest report, but the Justice Department didn't announce that she had been taken into custody until Monday — barely an hour after The Intercept published its report .
Winner's mother told NBC News on Tuesday that Winner “would not jeopardize anybody’s safety” and was “terrified” when she returned to her home in Augusta on Saturday to find federal agents waiting for her.

""Her words to me was that she was scared she was going to be ... they were going to make her disappear,"" Billie Winner-Davis said Tuesday.
Winner-Davis said that despite the allegations she remains ""a proud mom ... I have every reason to be proud of that girl.""
 ""I can't ever call her a traitor or even believe that,” she added. “No, that is not Reality. That's not her.""
The Intercept’s report described new details about Russian efforts to hack voting systems in the United States a week prior to the 2016 presidential election.
While the document doesn’t say the hacking changed any votes, the publication said it ""raises the possibility that Russian hacking may have breached at least some elements of the voting system, with disconcertingly uncertain results.""

The criminal complaint against Winner did not link the charges with the story, but a senior federal official confirmed to NBC News that Winner is the accused leaker of the document published by The Intercept. The NSA has a large facility in Georgia.
The Department of Justice has said Winner admitted to the accusations against her, but Nichols, told the Associated Press ""if there is a confession, the government has not shown it to me.""
Also on Tuesday, NSA leaker Edward Snowden said the law allowing Winner to be jailed was a threat to free press.
Snowden said the Espionage Act left no room to consider the public benefit of the information leaked as opposed to leaking information with the intent to harm the country.
“This often-condemned law provides no space to distinguish the extraordinary disclosure of inappropriately classified information in the public interest — whistleblowing — from the malicious disclosure of secrets to foreign governments by those motivated by a specific intent to harm to their countrymen,"" Snowden wrote on the Freedom of the Press Foundation website .

Black service members are significantly more likely to face military punishment than their white colleagues, according to a new report that alleges rampant racial bias in the military. 
The non-profit advocacy group Protect Our Defenders sifted through almost a decade's worth of government data obtained via Freedom of Information Act looking for clear disparities in the judicial treatment of white and black military personnel. 
""The data shows that, for every year reported and across all service branches, black service members were substantially more likely than white service members to face military justice or disciplinary action, and these disparities failed to improve or even increased in recent years,"" the report stated. 
""Depending on the service and type of disciplinary or justice action, black service members were at least 1.29 times and as much as 2.61 times more likely than white service members to have an action taken against them in an average year,"" according to the report. 13 PHOTOS See Gallery American soldiers in Mosul An American soldier takes a selfie at the U.S. army base in Qayyara, south of Mosul October 25, 2016.

Protect Our Defenders received data from four service branches — and found a higher proportion of discipline against black service members in all four. 
Black members of the Air Force were 71 percent more likely to ""face court-martial or non-judicial punishment than white air force members in an average year,"" the group said. 
In the Army, black soldiers were 61 percent more likely to get ""general or special court-martial compared to white service members."" 
And in the Navy, black sailors were 40 percent more likely than white sailors to be referred to special or general court-martial, the report said. Once referred, whites and blacks were equally likely to be convicted, the study found. 
Not all branches provided the same data, the study's authors said, making exact comparisons difficult. 
One of the biggest discrepancies came out of the Marine Corp where black Marines were 2.61 times more likely than white Marines to receive a guilty finding at a general court-martial. In non-judicial punishment proceedings black Marines were 32 percent more likely to be found guilty than whites in an average year, the report said. 
""While I was aware that this may have been happening, what surprised me is how pervasive it was across all boards in the military,"" said Col. Don Christensen, former chief prosecutor of the Air Force and president of Protect Our Defenders. 
""What's more alarming is that it's not getting better, it's getting worse,"" he said. 
The report identifies that the pattern of bias toward black personnel has gotten progressively grim over the years. 
Christensen said the reason behind the bias could be because the ""system is rigged"" against African Americans in the military. African-American are less likely to receive promotions or in-military education to advance, he said. 
The Pentagon said it would review the report. 
""It is longstanding Department of Defense policy that service members must be afforded the opportunity to serve in an environment free from unlawful racial discrimination. The Department will review any new information concerning implementation of and compliance with this policy once given the opportunity to review the report,"" Department of Defense spokesperson Johnny Michael said in a statement to NBC News. 
Findings in the report also suggest that ""decision-makers"" have a ""racial bias"" that is causing the severe discrepancy. 
""The report, while certainly eye-opening, should only be truly surprising if we believe that the United States military is a colorblind institution, which it is not and has never been,"" said Chad Williams, a professor of African and Afro-American Studies at Brandeis University. He said the same racial biases in the civilian criminal justice system are also in the military justice system. 
""The report reflects the continuation of a long historical practice of viewing black servicemen and women as a 'problem' that must be controlled through various measures, mostly notably the military justice system,"" he said. 
Evidence for other racial groups also varied, according to the data. Asian service members had lower ""military justice or disciplinary involvement than their white counterparts"" within the Army and the Navy, the report found. 
The report also alleges that military superiors were well aware of the racial bias. 
""Military leadership has been aware of significant racial disparity in its justice process for years, and has made no apparent effort to find the cause of the disparity or remedy it,"" the report reads. ""The leadership has vigorously opposed any suggestion that the commander-controlled justice system is hindered by conflicts of interest or bias and has gone to great lengths to tout the fairness of the system."" 
The military is the most respected institution and it has to live up to that reputation, Christensen said. ""They've had this data for years so it's time for them to be held accountable with action instead of them just throwing up a bumper sticker that says 'diversity is important,'"" he said.

Cosby sat stone-faced as he listened, a transcript of the exchange playing on a monitor for the benefit of jurors, who heard him offer to fund Andrea’s education and rebuff the mother’s demand that he reveal what “stuff” he gave her. 
""I would be willing to...meet with you guys,"" Cosby said. ""Lay out what I think is best. Pay for the schooling."" 
On the stand where her daughter had spent hours being cross-examined earlier in the day, Gianna Constand came off like Canada’s version of a Steel Magnolia, by turns folksy and fierce. 
“The mother instinct kicked into me,” she said of the moment her daughter confided in her about Cosby, who denies assaulting Constand and also denies dozens of accusations of sexual misconduct by other women that have not resulted in criminal charges. 
“I said if you don't give me his phone number I'm going to fly...I'm going to take the next flight out and I'm going to go talk to him."" Bill Cosby on the third day of his sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., June 7, 2017. BRENDAN MCDERMID / Reuters 
The semi-retired medical secretary said that her daughter had viewed Cosby, whom she met when she was working at Temple University, where he was a powerful trustee, as “a father.” 
When Andrea returned home to Canada in 2004 after quitting her job to pursue training as a massage therapist, she started having nightmares and “screaming in her sleep,” her mother said. 
Then, on Jan. 13, 2005, came a frantic phone call in which Andrea told her mother that she feared she had post-traumatic stress from an incident a year before in which Cosby had given her pills and then assaulted her while she was incapacitated during a visit to his home. 
“I was very upset and angry,” Gianna Constand said. “I was shaking.” 
She said she called Cosby and left a message for him. Then Andrea called Canadian police and made a report. 
When Cosby called back the next day, Gianna said she was “aggressive” with him, questioning why he had given her daughter medication. He asked that Andrea get on the line and then he began reeling off his version of what had happened. 
“He is telling me everything he physically did to her,” Gianna testified. “He said he was touching her breasts and he said to me, ‘But don’t worry, mom, there was no penile penetration, just digital penetration.’” 
“He said to me, ‘And mom she even had an orgasm,” the mother added. Bill Cosby accuser Andrea Constand on the third day of Cosby's sexual assault trial, June 7, 2017. Mark Makela / Getty Images 
Gianna Constand said that Cosby would not tell her what he gave Andrea but promised to figure it out, write it on a piece of paper and mail it to her. And, she testified, he apologized to both of them. 
By the end of the call, she said, she felt like Cosby was ""trying to lead me to believe that it was consensual, or that it was OK by her."" Cosby, sitting at the defense table, nodded and raised his eyebrows. 
Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele asked her why she so aggressively questioned Cosby on the phone. 
Gianna dropped her head into her hand and began to cry, then wiped her tears and spoke. 
""Just the fact that he betrayed her,"" she said. 
She said she wished she had taped the first phone call and on the advice of her son-in-law and a police officer, she bought a recorder and used it the next time she spoke to Cosby. 
But he didn’t go into the details he gave the first time. On the tape, she asks about his promise to send her the name of the pills. 
""We can talk about what you asked for later,"" Cosby responded. Andrea Constand testifies during Bill Cosby's trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse on June 6, 2017 in Norristown, Pennsylvania. Christine Cornell 
Under cross-examination, Gianna Constand was defiant at times. 
“Whatever. Whatever you are feeling. Whatever you think,” she said to defense lawyer Angela Agrusa at one point. 
“It doesn’t matter,” she said in response to another question, accusing the lawyer of trying to test her memory with “irrelevant things.” 
At one point, Gianna Constand turned and stared at Cosby, who was leaning back in his chair, with his eyes closed. After a long moment, she narrowed her eyes and turned back to the questioning. “ I would be willing to…meet with you guys. Lay out what I think is best. Pay for the schooling.” 
She took the stand immediately after her daughter, who began testifying Tuesday and then spent three more hours under cross-examination on Wednesday morning. 
The defense tried to hammer away at inconsistencies in statements she made to law-enforcement, particularly a discrepancy over the date of the alleged assault. Constand told Canadian police it occurred in March 2004 after they went out to a group dinner, but later told Pennsylvania police it was in January or February and that there was no meal beforehand. 
“I was mistaken,” she said of the earlier statement. 
During cross-examination, the defense tried to get Constand to say that she and Cosby had romantic liaisons before the night in question. 
She denied it, sticking to her story that he made “suggestive” advances that did not lead to sexual contact. The defense then did a bit of damage when it confronted her with the deposition from her 2005 civil suit against Cosby in which she said under oath that during a visit to his home, he had attempted to touch her genitals. 
The defense also quizzed her phone records that showed 72 calls between her and Cosby between the alleged assault and when she reported it to police. 
The goal was clear: to suggest that Constand had lied when she told police their contact after the night in question was limited and to plant the idea that a woman who had been sexually assaulted would not have kept up contact with her abuser. 
“You were calling Mr. Cosby with alarming frequency, weren’t you?” Agrusa asked. 
The impact was blunted when Constand pointed out, under questioning from the prosecutor, that many of the calls came after Cosby left messages for her and that he did not answer when she called back. “You were calling Mr. Cosby with alarming frequency, weren’t you?” 
Many of the calls happened before she quit her Temple job, and she said they concerned the women’s basketball team and she felt obligated to return them. There were a few efforts to reach Cosby the December after she left the university, though. 
The reason for those? 
“I wanted to know what pills he had given me,” Constand said. 
Pennsylvania lawyer Dennis McAndrews, a former prosecutor who is attending the trial, called the cross-examination “slow and stilted” and said it “barely diminished [Constand’s] credibility,” 
“On balance,” he said of Constand’s testimony across the two days, “her presentation was effective and convincing, but not without some chinks in the armor.” Tracy Connor ",Andrea Constand's Mother Confronts Bill Cosby at Sex Assault Trial - NBC News,normal,e35328eb85442a01944a857fefa06fc8408f2600

It's like Christmas in June. \n
. \n
For all of you morons still betrothed to Fake News NBC, who entirely failed to provide a link to the ACTUAL PDF posted on the Senate Intelligence Committee's website \n
Here it is. \n
https:\/\/www.intelligence.senate.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/documents\/os-jcomey-060817.pdf \n
(sidenote: look at the formatting of this NBC article. Was it written by a 3rd grader? LOL) \n
THREE TIMES in the testimony, Comey claims that he indeed assured Trump he was not personally under investigation. \n
First: \n \n
\""We did not have an open counter-intelligence case on [President-Elect Trump]. During our one-on-one meeting at Trump Tower, ... without him directly asking the question, I offered that assurance.\"" \n \n
Second: \n \n
(On 2nd one-on-one dinner meeting with Trump): \""I replied that he should give [ordering a investigation into the Steel dossier] careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren't.\"" \n \n
Third: \n \n
(phone call): \""I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump\"" \n \n
. \n
Oh, and hey! The memo is actually real. It just doesn't say what you think it says. Trump asked to drop any investigation of Flynn based on known-fake news. That's quite fair, and perfectly legal. \n \n
\""I immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership. I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. I did not understand the President to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. \"" \n \n
. \n
Ouch....rough day, liberals. \n
I'm sure the Washington Post will write some story next week and \""it will finally happen\"" and then you'll finally get to impeach Trump. Or not. \/facepalm",Comey to Testify He Assured He Was Not Personally Under Investigation,normal,2073d0052ca3331f7f470ee2c102cc50d0004628

Comey's prepared testimony make it clear that in the follow up conversations he had with Trump POTUS never once followed up on anything else about the Russian investigation but that, other than to repeatedly claim how the whole Russian investigation was \""a cloud\"" preventing Trump from doing his job. Trump expressed a desire for Comey to publicly \""get out\"" the fact that Trump was not (at that time) personally under investigation by the FBI. \n
One has to wonder as to the motive behind Trump's repeated attempts to persuade the then FBI Director to take such a step? \n
What's the rush to get that out there, and why? \n
The fact, at that time, that Trump himself was not personally under investigation by the FBI would not in any way diminish the broader Russian investigation from being \""a cloud\"" over his presidency. \n
Indeed, Trump's alluding to the possibility that some of his \""satellites\"" may have done something wrong regarding Russia, but he didn't, might have added fuel to the Russian investigation, broadening and or deepening its scope, if that tidbit was ever publicly shared, as it now has been. \n
How would that affect \""a cloud\""? Surly it wouldn't dissipate it, and Trump undoubtedly knows that. \n
So does Trump's ego and personal self esteem provide the only motivations for his wanting the FBI Director to go on record making a statement that Trump isn't personally under investigation by the FBI? \n
 As the bard put it \""at the length truth will out,\"" \n
Someone who's innocent of wrongdoing confidently knows that, someone who's concerned about their innocence wants it publicly declared and attested to by others, ahead of when the \""truth will out\"".",Comey to Testify He Assured He Was Not Personally Under Investigation,normal,3e2a7dbbf517aeb647bf9d74ede81bfa10fbf551

Whitney says Gianforte's legal team did not respond to requests to clarify precisely how the congressman-elect would plead. 
On the eve of a May 25 special election for the House in Montana, Gianforte was about to do a television interview when Jacobs asked a question about congressional Republicans' health care plan when — as captured in an audio recording — Gianforte physically attacked him. Jacobs is heard on the recording saying the candidate had body-slammed him and broken his glasses. 
A spokesman for Gianforte issued a statement saying Jacobs, brandishing a cellphone, interrupted an interview and badgered the candidate with questions, and that Gianforte reacted by attempting ""to grab the phone that was pushed in his face."" 
""Jacobs grabbed Greg's wrist, and spun away from Greg, pushing them both to the ground,"" Gianforte spokesman Shane Scanlon said. ""It's unfortunate that this aggressive behavior from a liberal journalist created this scene at our campaign volunteer BBQ."" 
As we reported, three Fox News reporters who were in the room preparing for the interview with Gianforte confirmed that the candidate ""grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground ... then began punching the reporter."" 
Later that evening, the sheriff cited Gianforte for misdemeanor assault . The next day, Gianforte was elected to the House. 
In his letter of apology to Jacobs, Gianforte says, ""You did not initiate any physical contact with me and I had no right to assault you. I am sorry for what I did."" 
He says, ""I understand the critical role that journalists and the media play in our society. ... I acknowledge that the media have an obligation to seek information."" 
Gianforte says, ""In the hope that some good can come of these events, I am making a $50,000 contribution to the Committee to Protect Journalists."" 
Jacobs responded: 
""I have accepted Mr. Gianforte's apology and his willingness to take responsibility for his actions and statements. I hope the constructive resolution of this incident reinforces for all the importance of respecting the freedom of the press and the First Amendment and encourages more civil and thoughtful discourse in our country.""","Montana's Gianforte, Sorry He Hit Reporter, Promises Donation To Charity : The Two-Way : NPR",normal,c30f96411cdbd725286be8ddb43428b7eb8749ba

Timelines are the life blood on finding the criminals, killers, and the everyday bad things people do to each other. Timelines are shown as maps, pie charts, pyramids, and forensic models on the walls of detective rooms. Like you've seen in the movies. We have the best of the best con artists who work in our swampland given us a terrible display of their mockery and distain for us (we the people). You don't have to be an Einstein or a Sherlock to figure out that timelines come in shape shifting ways, by imagination. Imagination comes before reality, but it's not very well understood. 
Bottom line: Section 702 was started by Bush right after 911. The baby was born. It has gone thru revision, with one being Snowden outing its evil side. Back in mid 2000 there was a horse racing track in Michigan. Phones were bugged for ""chatter"", to locate cells of the terrorists communicating with each other. The jockeys at this track were fixing their own races. They placed bets to East coast bookies and betting outlets. Vegas and Reno wouldn't take bets from Michigan tracks, because they were so crooked. The NSA picked up daily calls going to the East coast. So, they started listening, and got jockeys making bets. It was illegal an illegal wiretap. The track owner was notified and threw the jockeys off the track. No one was prosecuted because of the illegality. This leads me to ask this? In the hearing today, timeline was brought up twice by the Senators. Two Senators ask if there was an uptick of unmasking of names in 2016. The answers were lies. If they weren't lies, those being grilled should be fired and arrested for guarding our country under false pretenses. 
They answered the question with ""DUH"". One guy says I'll see if my staff kept those statistics. Seriously? That is your wall chart, pie chart, and pyramid on the top. Senator Cornyn caught the light going off, and he excused the reason for not keeping records. He said that 702 is the point of inquiry, and all else is irrelevant. 
Like saying we got the murderer, forget about the accomplices. Pure pond scum, Mr Cornyn.
Susan Rice, Samantha Power, and Brennan were unmasking names. Brennan had an excuse. The other two had no investigative reason to unmask, unless Obama or Ben Rhodes asked them to. The names were then given to WAPO and NY TIMES as leaks against Flynn. Eight days before he left office, Obama signed a law that allowed unmasked names to be exchanged openly between all 16 plus intel agencies. That grandfathered 120 employees on the list of who could be the leaker. The chatter of the timeline needs to be looked at of Samantha Power and Susan Rice. Frequency of them unmasking names. THEN, who asked them to unmask? They would never have thought of it on their own. Then, you have Obama or Ben Rhodes having to give their reason to unmask Trump's people names. This Russian thing could or could not matter, but it is a sideshow. I said my piece.",President Trump and James Comey: A timeline of their relationship,normal,6761d01a3d32425d449beb7b05fa576aa56e0027

DAWEI, Myanmar — A navy ship and local fishermen found bodies and aircraft parts in the seas off Myanmar on Thursday, a day after a military plane carrying 120 people disappeared, a military spokesman said. 
The Chinese-made Y-8 turboprop aircraft lost contact 29 minutes after takeoff from Myeik, also known as Mergui, while flying at 18,000 feet over the Andaman Sea.

Gen. Myat Min Oo said local fishermen had found seven bodies after a navy ship located two life jackets, three bodies and a tire that was part of an aircraft wheel. The wreckage was found in the sea west of the town of Laung Lone. 
The plane carried 106 passengers — mostly families of military personnel — and 14 crew members. Fifteen of the passengers were children. 
It is the rainy season in Myanmar but a civil aviation official said the weather had been ""normal"" with good visibility when the aircraft took off. 
The plane was bought in March 2016 and had a total of 809 flying hours. It was carrying 2.4 tons of supplies, the military said. 
Nicknamed the ""air camel"" in Chinese, the multi-purpose aircraft was approved for production in 1980 and is still being produced by Shaanxi Aircraft Corporation, a unit of state-owned Aviation Industry Corp of China.

The ACA only needed a few tweaks and it could have worked for everyone. If they felt it wouldn't, medicare for all most certainly would.
They say the ACA is dying on its feet right now.>YES it is .Thanks to Trump refusing to send the medicaid money to the states for it.
The aim is to cut medicaid.. Which doesn't just serve the poor , it is also what keeps the elderly in nursing homes.. Provides much needed home services for anyone who is ill and needs special help or equipment at home. EVEN babies and children.
What do they want to do with that money?
Give it to the rich ..
So OH HELL YES, the democrats are in their way.
Giving this back to for profit insurance companies, with the cuts to medicaid, and the other tricks they are lying about.. Are all aimed to make insurance companies richer. AGAIN.
YES if you keep your insurance with a pre existing condition you can stay on it.. BUT, what if you are too sick to keep it???? Lose it for even ONE day..? Then forget it.. You will NEVER qualify again.
People forgot why the ACA was implemented?
For profit insurance companies took the money and sold lousy policies..
Before ACA was implemented insurance company CEO's were making billions.. Living in mansions ...Like Kings. Obama forced them to only make a certain amount of profit OR give rebates back to people.
The insurance companies before the ACA.. Paid people to slow serve the sick and dying who deserved their insurance to come through.People also found out they did not have the insurance they thought they had..NOPE..READ THE SMALL PRINT FOLKS....
Caps? Well thats great.. Some problems exceed a million in short order. Too bad if your insurance only pays about 50,000.00.. The rest is yours. And then of course NOW you have a pre existing condition.
The list is endless.
The price? Hate to tell you folks but the cost was astronomical BEFORE the ACA.
Mine went from 30.00 a month to 850.00 a month in 6 short years.. 16 years ago~!!
Don't let them lie to you.. 
The ACA was a wonderful thing. And needed some tweaks..Instead the GOP tweaked everything they could that would ruin it.
Hate your insurance ?
Its not the ACA doing it..Its the GOP....","Trump says ""the Democrats are really in our way"" on health care",normal,45450df6be723e9a2768c6e9d72c9ea3dd5bd427

JERSEY CITY, N.J. -- A wild police chase through the streets of Jersey City late Sunday ended in a fiery crash, a driver's clothes on fire, police caught on video kicking that man, prosecutors investigating the incident, city officials raising the possibility of firing officers involved, and the police union defending officers who were there, reports CBS New York . 
The sequence of events was still murky early Thursday, but it all apparently began with police getting a call about shots being fired and trying to pull over a car that then sped from the scene, authorities say. 
During the pursuit, police fired several shots at the car as it caused accidents, then crashed into a utility pole, taking another vehicle with it, says CBS New York. 
Flames burst from the two cars wrapped around the telephone pole, with downed electric wires fueling the fires. The scene was captured on video by onlookers. 
Witnesses told CBS New York that, moments earlier, they saw squad cars getting into formation. ""They came out into the middle of the road and created a barricade,"" witness Tom Evans told CBS New York. ""As that barricade was being created, there was a loud boom. Two cars smashed into one another and into a telephone pole."" 
Man who had just rolled out of one of two burning cars is seen (slightly to left and down from center of picture) in still from video with flames coming from what looked like his upper torso but he tossed away his shirt or jacket and flames went with it; this all followed end of wild police pursuit that culminated in two vehicles crashing into telephone poll and bursting into flames in Jersey City, N.J. late on June 4, 2017 Erik Roberto 
As officers worked to rescue a trapped driver inside one vehicle, another man took off running from the scene, according to Evans. ""There was another guy that flew out of one of the cars,"" Evans said. ""They were aggressive after him, handcuffed him and threw him in the back of a cop car."" 
But video also captures a man rolling out of one of the cars, flames surrounding his upper torso. He sits up and pulls off and throws away a jacket or shirt, which was apparently what was burning. He then collapses flat on the ground. 
Officers are seen on the video surrounding the man with guns drawn, kicking him, and finally dragging him away. 
A 28-year-old authorities say was an innocent victim in the second car was badly burned, and the driver police were pursuing was also recovering in a hospital late Monday. 
That driver – identified as Leo Pinkston, 48, of Jersey City– was facing eluding and assault charges. 
Several police officers suffered minor injuries but had been released from the hospital by Monday evening. 
There was no word late Monday on whether Pinkston was linked to the shots fired call. There was also no word on whether he is the man seen being kicked by the officers. 
Jersey City spokesperson Jennifer Morrill issued a statement saying in part, ""We are working with the Hudson County Prosecutor's Officer and are in the process of identifying the officers on this video. Once we clearly identify all the officers involved, we will be seeking termination in addition to any possible criminal penalties in appropriate cases."" 
The president of the Jersey City Police union, Carmine Disbrow, said in a statement that, ""As it should be, this entire incident is being fully investigated. Taking swift action isn't always elegant, but this video clearly shows that the officers acted quickly to extinguish the flames, and pull this man out of harm's way."" © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Derek Montgomery for NPR This week the podcast and show Invisibilia examines the nature of reality, with a Silicon Valley techie who created apps to randomize his life ; a psychologist who trains herself to experience the world like dogs do; and a wildlife biologist who thinks bears aren't dangerous. 
When you live in northern Minnesota, wildlife is usually no big deal. A giant bull moose casually strolled through our neighborhood in Duluth a couple summers ago, past screaming and slack-jawed kids at a nearby park. Wolves also have ventured into town, occasionally killing dogs that strayed too far from their owners. Deer are as common as flies, and I only seem to notice them when they jump out in front of my car.
But bears are different. I hadn't seen one in town, while driving or even at the zoo. So in 2012, when Minnesota Public Radio reporter Dan Kraker asked if I wanted to join him as he went out with wildlife biologist Lynn Rogers to find a bear, I jumped at the opportunity.

Derek Montgomery for NPR Dan was going to write a story about Rogers' work putting webcams in bear dens and radio collars on bears. That work is controversial; he argues that it's creating a priceless database on the animals' behavior. Others say that because he feeds bears and touches them, the bears become accustomed to humans and pose a danger to people who aren't accustomed to wild bears approaching them. (In 2014, the state Department of Natural Resources rescinded Rogers' permit to collar bears, citing complaints from local residents.)

National Security Comey Opening Statement For Senate Intelligence Hearing, Annotated James Comey's appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee is unlike any event on Capitol Hill in recent years — anticipated for weeks, the subject of huge national scrutiny and scheduled for wall-to-wall news coverage.
Politics Comey: Trump Asked For 'Loyalty,' Wanted Him to 'Let' Flynn Investigation 'Go' The committee posted Comey's opening statement online Wednesday afternoon. A careful pattern of expectations-management and narrative-shaping has sought to establish the parameters for what he probably will not say.
Politics The James Comey Saga, In Timeline Form Even so, the hearing may well live up to the hype.
Senators will have had a day to prepare detailed questions about Comey's public opening statement.
Democrats want to tease out more information. Republicans want to knock holes in Comey's story.
For example:
Comey confirms President Trump's claim that he was not ""personally"" under investigation by the FBI — but what does ""personally"" mean, and was that only true at the time or is it so now? Comey does not detail every conversation he and Trump had — why not, and what did he omit from his statement? Did Comey's fellow intelligence agency bosses ever ask him to back off the Flynn investigation? When Trump asked Comey to lay off Flynn, did Comey understand that Trump was asking him to leave Flynn alone just over allegedly lying to Vice President Pence — or the other, earlier potential transgressions he might have committed? ""I am hopeful that he will clarify for the American people recent events that have been broadly reported in the media,"" Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., said when he announced the session.
The panel's vice chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., says it's an opportunity for Comey to respond to the ""disparagement"" he has endured from Trump, who reportedly told Russian guests at the Oval Office the day after the firing that Comey was a ""nut job."" 
It's also a chance for an appearance by Comey the raconteur, the teller of memorable tales. He held Washington spellbound with his now-famous story about racing to the sickbed of then-Attorney General John Ashcroft when the White House wanted to lean on him to reauthorize a surveillance program.
On Thursday, the former FBI director has at least two scenes to unfold, according to his opening statement. First, Comey at a private dinner for two with Trump in the White House at which the president asked him for his ""loyalty.""
""It turned out to be just the two of us, seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room,"" Comey wrote. ""Two Navy stewards waited on us, only entering the room to serve food and drinks.""
Or Comey seated in a meeting in the Oval Office — then Trump asking everyone else to leave the room for a private request: ""I hope you can let this go.""
National Security Intelligence Chiefs Decline To Discuss Private Talks With Trump Comey's onetime fellow spy bosses were not forthcoming on Wednesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers declined to detail their private conversations with Trump in an open hearing .
Neither a law school clinic on witness-questioning from Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., nor a thunderous demand by Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, for the legal justification for their non-answers got the two intelligence bosses to budge.
""I stand by my previous answer,"" Rogers repeated.
Republican allies of Trump touted the answers that Coats and Rogers gave about never feeling ""pressure"" to lay off Flynn or the inquiry into potential connections between Trump's camp and Russia's meddling in the election last year.
Comey, however, does describe repeated requests and feelings of ""concern.""
So the demand among senators Thursday for Comey to elaborate on his written statement and the past accounts in The Washington Post and The New York Times may prove intense.
At least one important player said he was pleased by Comey's account.
Marc Kasowitz, the outside lawyer representing President Trump and to whom the White House has been referring questions regarding the Russia investigation, released a statement on Wednesday evening hailing Comey's account.
""The president is pleased that Mr. Comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the president was not under investigation in any Russian probe,"" Kasowitz said. ""The president feels completely and totally vindicated. He is eager to continue to move forward with his agenda.""
On the other hand, Comey's friend Benjamin Wittes of the blog Lawfare posted an analysis of the prepared opening statement on Wednesday that took a different interpretation about what Comey did and did not say.
""Despite this sparseness,"" he wrote, ""or maybe I should say because of it, it is the most shocking single document compiled about the official conduct of the public duties of any president since the release of the Watergate tapes.""",Ex-FBI Director James Comey Testifies On Capitol Hill Thursday.

This week the podcast and show Invisibilia examines the nature of reality, with a Silicon Valley techie who created apps to randomize his life ; a wildlife biologist who thinks bears aren't dangerous; and a psychologist who trains herself to experience the world like dogs do . 
Noses are the unsung feature of the face, sunscreened or surgically fixed, but rarely exalted. And the sense they enable, smelling, is likewise uncelebrated. Regularly voted the ""sense I'd be most willing to lose"", olfaction is largely ignored — unless it brings word of something savory or foul nearby. 
But we are born smellers. After being enveloped while in the womb in the smell of our mother and the foods she ingested, babies emerge macrosmatic, keen-smelling. They find the mother's nipple and recognize their parents by scent. Children can identify their siblings and friends by smell. In those earliest sniffings, smelling is all about discovery and navigation. 
Gradually, though, we forsake our noses. What have you smelled today? Perhaps a half-dozen odors, mostly likely food or manufactured fragrance, or maybe one. Or none. Over the same period, your dog has sniffed his way out of sleep, come to examine your smell in the morning, busily investigated the smell leavings from the night before on your walk outside, and may have found his way to his fellow canines by scent. Reality Check 
What happens when people can't agree on reality? Alix Spiegel and co-host Hanna Rosin examine how two people can look at the same thing and experience two different emotions in the second episode of Season 3 of the NPR podcast Invisibilia . 
We admire the dog's olfactory acuity, and we should: dogs have hundreds of millions more olfactory receptors, the cells at the back of the nose that grab odors out of the air, than we do. They have two dedicated, separate routes in their snouts for sniffing and breathing; they have elaborate bones in their nose that hold yet more olfactory tissue; they even exhale out the side slits of their nostrils in order not to disturb the odors coming in. And as the performance of dogs that do tracking, search-and-rescue, and other detection tasks, they can use their highly sensitive olfactory instruments to locate substances that we never even thought had an odor: cancerous cells; minute quantities of TNT; the day-old footprint left by a missing person. 
All is not lost for us humans, though. We have the equipment, and, while not as varied or extensive as the dogs', it works perfectly well. Last month John McGann, an Associate Professor at Rutgers, published a review in Science last month reminding us that humans do, after all, have an olfactory bulb, and Swedish professor Matthias Laska has extensively demonstrated that in detecting some odors, such as amyl acetate (which smells like banana), we are plenty sensitive. Our experience of the flavor of food is mostly due to smell, experienced through the back of the mouth — retronasal olfaction — instead of through the nostrils. 
Knowing all this, I recently embarked on a project culminating in my book Being a Dog: Following the Dog into a World of Smell, in which I tried to improve my sense of smell by following the dog's lead, as well as that of some olfactory experts, among them a perfumer, a sommelier, and a pair of animal trackers. Dogs excepted, few of these experts were born noses. I learned that a few simple steps can change your nose from neglected to noticed, as it had for them: 
Stick your nose in it. Consider a dog's daily behavior, and contrast it with the frequency with which you see a person with nose smashed against a surface, inhaling calmly and confidently. Simply getting closer to a source and bravely sniffing will bring more odor molecules into our noses. Subscribe to Invisibilia 
Get over it. In the U.S., at least, our culture is a discourager of smells. The baby who notices an interesting smell? Her parents ignore her. Eventually, she will think of smells in a mostly binary way, as lovely or horrible. By contrast, experts in smelling view odors merely as information, not intrinsically good or bad, just as the images that we see tell us about our world. Treat scents like sights and it becomes easier to smell. 
Name the source. Once you start bringing your attention to what you smell, you may be at a loss for words: English doesn't have much of a vocabulary for smells. So olfactory experts create their own jargon. You can adopt theirs, but consider, too, our smell memories: The scent of cedar mixed with tobacco that floods me with memories of my father's desk; a whiff of pencil shavings, zipping me back to learning cursive in my third grade classroom. Find your own language, images or memories to represent the smell, and in so doing it will be easier to invoke the next time you sniff it. 
Even after spending months learning how to smell like a dog, observing detection dog training, following truffle dogs, and accompanying my own dog train in the sport of ""nose work"", I feel certain: I don't experience the world my dog does. But my own world is changed: It smells. And by smelling intentionally instead of just letting smells happen to me, odors have lost their simplicity. 
I'm glad to smell my family and friends. I know the smell of the afternoon in my office, warmed by sun, as well as the smell of the advent of spring. Before opening my eyes on awakening this morning, I could smell that the dogs and cat had joined me in bed, but my husband was up. In the next hour, I smelled mown grass and a waft of cloves in the park; the mustiness of a raincoat taken out of a back closet; when the toast was ready; and the beautiful, straw-like smell of the top of my son's head. I relish it all. ",People Can Learn To Use Their Sense Of Smell Like A Dog Does : Shots - Health News : NPR,normal,8a23723eb3a268f6eb454a1f5cede2563e09f263

The big three investigations are being run by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the House Intelligence Committee and the Department of Justice special counsel Robert Mueller. 
Here's a primer to help you sort out which investigation is doing what. Senate Intelligence Committee 
What is it focusing on? 
The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is conducting a broad inquiry looking at what, exactly, Russia did to influence the 2016 elections and how that fits into broader ""cyberactivity and active measures "" the country has used to target the United States. Part of that includes examining whether there is any evidence that members of Donald Trump's campaign collaborated with Russian operatives. 
""The Committee will follow the intelligence wherever it leads,"" Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Vice Chair Mark Warner, D-Va., said in a statement announcing the probe. 
""We will be conducting the bulk of the Committee's business behind closed doors because we take seriously our obligation to protect sources and methods."" 
Key players 
The panel is being led by Burr. He advised the Trump campaign last year but has vowed to take the investigation seriously. ""It overrides any personal beliefs that I have or loyalties that I might have,"" he told reporters earlier this year. 
Burr has separated himself from the Trump administration more than other key Republicans involved in Russia investigations. He voiced concerns about Comey's firing and has said he has seen no evidence backing one of Trump's more outlandish claims — that President Barack Obama ordered a ""wiretap"" of Trump Tower during the presidential campaign. 
Warner is the top Democrat on the committee. While the House Intelligence Committee has been characterized by partisan infighting, Warner has worked hard to present a united front with Burr. The two-term senator and former governor has repeatedly said the investigation is the ""most important thing I've ever done"" in public service. 
The Senate Intelligence Committee has several members who are often speculated about as future presidential candidates: Republicans Marco Rubio of Florida and Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Democrat Kamala Harris of California. 
Most memorable public moment 
The Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation has, up until this point, been defined by its bipartisan nature. 
That is due in part not only to inevitable comparisons to the often-gridlocked House Intelligence Committee's investigation but also to a concerted effort being made by Burr and Warner. 
Most of the Senate investigation's meetings and hearings have taken place behind closed doors. Comey's testimony before the panel will most assuredly be its most high-profile moment. But up until now, the Senate investigation's key characteristic has been the fact that Warner and Burr are, by and large, on the same page when it comes to the focus and pace of their investigation. 
What the investigation could lead to 
Burr and Warner have said their goal is to produce a detailed, bipartisan report summing up what actions Russian operatives took in 2016 and how similar attacks can be prevented in future elections. 
The committee can't recommend criminal charges, as the special counsel investigation is empowered to do. House Intelligence Committee 
What is it focusing on? 
Like its Senate counterpart, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence wants to write a report answering four questions: What did Russia do to influence the 2016 election? Were there any links between Russian operatives ""and individuals associated with political campaigns""? How did the federal government respond to these efforts? How and why was classified information leaked during this process? 
Chairman Devin Nunes and other Republicans on the committee have publicly focused much of their attention on leaks and whether the Obama administration "" unmasked "" intelligence about Trump associates for political purposes. 
Key players 
California Republican Nunes remains chair of the House Intelligence Committee, though in April, he temporarily stepped down as head of its Russia investigation. Nunes' move came in response to an Ethics Committee inquiry into whether he improperly disclosed classified information over the course of the investigation. 
The ethics probe was launched after Nunes made a high-profile trip to the White House to discuss information that he claimed raised questions about whether the Obama administration had improperly ""unmasked"" — or asked for the identity of — Trump associates surveilled during routine foreign intelligence operations. He spoke to reporters about this information before telling his colleagues on the committee about it. ""The committee has been put into suspended animation,"" Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., told MSNBC afterwards. 
Nunes later admitted that his information had initially come from the Trump administration. That raised questions about whether Nunes was providing political cover for the president he was investigating. 
While Nunes stepped down from the Russia investigation, he has continued to issue and sign investigation-related subpoenas. 
Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, is leading the Russia investigation in Nunes' place. 
California Rep. Adam Schiff is the top Democrat on the committee and one of the most commonly seen public faces of the Russia inquiries. 
As the committee's investigation became more partisan, Schiff was forthright not just with the available evidence of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia — but also with what it would mean if such a thing were proven true. 
""Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated, and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence? Yes, it is possible. But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated, and that the Russians used the same techniques to corrupt U.S. persons that they have employed in Europe and elsewhere. We simply don't know, not yet, and we owe it to the country to find out,"" Schiff said at a March hearing featuring Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers. 
Conaway and Schiff tried to repair public confidence in the bipartisan integrity of their investigation by making a joint press statement on Tuesday. 
Most memorable public moment 
Nunes' White House trips created weeks of headlines. But the committee's public hearings have led to several key moments, as well. 
The most notable: Comey's first public disclosure of an active FBI probe into whether anyone on Trump's campaign colluded with Russian efforts to influence the election. 
What it could lead to 
The House Intelligence Committee's end goal is a report laying out its findings. Like the Senate committee, the House investigation wouldn't lead to criminal charges. 
The key question is whether the House Intelligence Committee will issue one bipartisan report or two separate findings from its Republican and Democratic camps. Special Counsel, Department Of Justice 
What is it focusing on? 
On May 17, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Mueller to take charge of the FBI investigation into whether anyone on Trump's campaign colluded with Russian operatives. 
This is the leading Russia investigation but also the most secretive. While the House and Senate committees play out in high-profile public hearings, Mueller's investigation will take place behind closed doors. Congressional investigations also tend to defer to law enforcement when it comes to access to witnesses and evidence. 
Muller is charged with investigating ""any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Campaign of President Donald Trump; and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation."" 
That second clause has been interpreted to include the question of whether Trump or other White House officials improperly acted to impede the FBI investigation and likely includes the circumstances of the dismissals of both former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Comey . 
Key players 
Mueller led the FBI for 12 years and began his tenure just a week before the Sept. 11 terror attacks. He's widely respected in Washington. 
Other key members of Mueller's investigative team include former FBI Chief of Staff Aaron Zebley; onetime Watergate prosecutor James Quarles; Andrew Weissmann, who led the Department of Justice's fraud division and helped investigate Enron; and Jeannie Rhee, who worked in the Justice Department, as well as Mueller's law firm WilmerHale. 
Most memorable public moment 
Over the course of his career, Mueller developed a reputation as someone who does not leak to the news media. So we don't know too much about how the investigation is going. 
So the most memorable moment of the investigation is probably Rosenstein's surprise announcement that he was appointing Mueller to begin with. 
What it could lead to 
Special counsel investigations into White Houses are notoriously unpredictable. Ken Starr's probe into Bill and Hillary Clinton's alleged real estate improprieties led to a report about Bill Clinton's extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky and the president's eventual impeachment. 
The investigation into whether the Bush White House improperly leaked the name of CIA operative Valerie Plame ultimately led to a top White House aide, Scooter Libby, being convicted of obstruction of justice and perjury. 
The key detail here is that Mueller has the power to press criminal charges based on what his investigation uncovers. And his investigation is likely to have broader scope and intensity than the congressional committees, so its findings could have political ramifications as well. And the rest... 
While those are the three most high-profile Russia investigations, there are various other inquiries in different parts of the federal government. Those include: The Senate Armed Services Committee, led by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has been tasked with looking for ways to improve cybersecurity and protect against future hacking by foreign actors. The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, led by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., held the hearing at which former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified that she had warned the Trump White House that she believed Flynn was ""compromised."" The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has been looking at Flynn's payments from Russia and Turkey . Ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings of Maryland has largely driven the narrative on that angle, releasing evidence at various times. The committee also joined the Senate Judiciary Committee, with oversight of the FBI, and the Senate Intelligence Committee in requesting copies of Comey's memos detailing private interactions with Trump. The Department of Defense Inspector General is also investigating Flynn's payments from Russia and Turkey to determine whether those payments broke laws against former officers receiving foreign payments without advance approval. The House Financial Services Committee's Democratic members have been requesting documents from Deutsche Bank to investigate whether Trump has been given any loans backed by Russian interests.

This week, the podcast and show Invisibilia examines the nature of reality, with a Silicon Valley techie who created apps to randomize his life, a psychologist who trains herself to experience the world like dogs do and a wildlife biologist who thinks bears aren't dangerous. 
In San Francisco, the life Max Hawkins lived was arguably perfect. 
He was employed by Google, surrounded by friends and had his routine nailed down. He woke to artisanal coffee, biked to work along the beautiful Embarcadero waterfront roadway, lunched on Google's famed free food (""like four different kinds of kale"" level) and — possibly the true mark of a successful millennial — got invited to many happy hours. 
But something was missing. 
Sometimes Max would lay awake at night pondering what felt so ... wrong. 
""I just started thinking about these loops that we get into,"" he says. ""And about how the structure of your life ... completely determines what happens in it."" 
Max's once beautiful routine suddenly seemed unfulfilling. He felt like he was growing closer to people in his own bubble and becoming isolated from those outside of it. 
""There was something ... that just made me feel trapped,"" he says. ""Like I was reading a story that I'd read before or I was playing out someone else's script."" Reality Check 
How is it that two people can look at the same thing and see something completely different? Alix Spiegel and co-host Hanna Rosin tackle the notion of bubbles and follow two people making radical attempts to break out of them in the latest episode of Season 3 of the NPR podcast Invisibilia . 
As any computer developer would do, Max turned to technology to craft his way out — a series of randomization applications. 
Max started small, with an app that integrated Uber. It starts like a regular ride-hailing app: He would press a button in the app and a car would arrive. But then, a twist: He couldn't select a drop-off location; the app would choose a spot within a range without disclosing it. The only thing the rider had to do was enjoy the journey — and hope for a good destination. 
From there, Max's applications became more complex. He built an app that used a Facebook search function for public events to find ones near him. Then the app would randomly choose which event Max would attend. 
At first, he was nervous: What if people wouldn't let him in? But, as a kind of unassuming white guy, he actually didn't have this problem. (And Max acknowledges this privilege.) Once Max explained how and why he had arrived at these events, hosts usually welcomed him, often with only a few questions asked. Most of the time, people were taken by the idea of Max expanding his bubble. 
One night, he got to drink white Russians with some Russians. Another, he attended acroyoga (as in, acrobatics + yoga). A community center pancake breakfast. A networking event for young professionals. The algorithm chose; Max attended. 
Most of these events were something that the nonrandomized Max would never have thought to try. The computer was breaking him out of a life driven by his own preferences. He was suddenly seeing the world in a whole new way, and he really liked it. 
For two years, Hawkins let his app guide him around the globe, including a stop in Gortina, Slovenia. Courtesy of Max Hawkins hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Max Hawkins For two years, Hawkins let his app guide him around the globe, including a stop in Gortina, Slovenia. Courtesy of Max Hawkins 
""If I went out myself and said, like, 'I want to see the world!' I have an idea of what I need to see to do that,"" Max says. ""But when I'm turning that over to a random algorithm, it has its own different idea. You're taking on the computer's view of the world, and because that's not human, it's likely to be completely different from your own."" 
One year, Max decided to use the Facebook-event generator app to choose where he would celebrate Christmas. It came up with a party at someone's home in Fresno, Calif. 
With a pie and a friend, Max drove for three hours and showed up on the doorstep of a retired psychologist, Karena Beasley. Karena was celebrating with a handful of friends and family — and now, also two 20-something strangers. 
""She was completely not fazed,"" Max says, describing the moment they met Karena. ""She didn't miss a beat. She said, 'Oh, wonderful! We love Facebook, I'm so glad you're at the party. Welcome.' And it was like instantly we were friends."" 
Max says he and his friend stayed at the party for five or six hours. In a video from the night, the group sings carols to guitar and Max looks as if he is right where he belongs. 
Max lived a randomized life for the better part of two years. In fact, he went global. He created an app that chose the places he would live, travel and eat. When he traveled, he continued using the Facebook events app to find random activities.

JERSEY CITY, N.J. -- A wild police chase through the streets of Jersey City late Sunday ended in a fiery crash, a driver's clothes on fire, police caught on video kicking that man, prosecutors investigating the incident, city officials raising the possibility of firing officers involved, and the police union defending officers who were there, reports CBS New York . 
The sequence of events was still murky early Thursday, but it all apparently began with police getting a call about shots being fired and trying to pull over a car that then sped from the scene, authorities say. 
During the pursuit, police fired several shots at the car as it caused accidents, then crashed into a utility pole, taking another vehicle with it, says CBS New York. 
Flames burst from the two cars wrapped around the telephone pole, with downed electric wires fueling the fires. The scene was captured on video by onlookers. 
Witnesses told CBS New York that, moments earlier, they saw squad cars getting into formation. ""They came out into the middle of the road and created a barricade,"" witness Tom Evans told CBS New York. ""As that barricade was being created, there was a loud boom. Two cars smashed into one another and into a telephone pole."" 
Man who had just rolled out of one of two burning cars is seen (slightly to left and down from center of picture) in still from video with flames coming from what looked like his upper torso but he tossed away his shirt or jacket and flames went with it; this all followed end of wild police pursuit that culminated in two vehicles crashing into telephone poll and bursting into flames in Jersey City, N.J. late on June 4, 2017 Erik Roberto 
As officers worked to rescue a trapped driver inside one vehicle, another man took off running from the scene, according to Evans. ""There was another guy that flew out of one of the cars,"" Evans said. ""They were aggressive after him, handcuffed him and threw him in the back of a cop car."" 
But video also captures a man rolling out of one of the cars, flames surrounding his upper torso. He sits up and pulls off and throws away a jacket or shirt, which was apparently what was burning. He then collapses flat on the ground. 
Officers are seen on the video surrounding the man with guns drawn, kicking him, and finally dragging him away. 
A 28-year-old authorities say was an innocent victim in the second car was badly burned, and the driver police were pursuing was also recovering in a hospital late Monday. 
That driver – identified as Leo Pinkston, 48, of Jersey City– was facing eluding and assault charges. 
Several police officers suffered minor injuries but had been released from the hospital by Monday evening. 
There was no word late Monday on whether Pinkston was linked to the shots fired call. There was also no word on whether he is the man seen being kicked by the officers. 
Jersey City spokesperson Jennifer Morrill issued a statement saying in part, ""We are working with the Hudson County Prosecutor's Officer and are in the process of identifying the officers on this video. Once we clearly identify all the officers involved, we will be seeking termination in addition to any possible criminal penalties in appropriate cases."" 
The president of the Jersey City Police union, Carmine Disbrow, said in a statement that, ""As it should be, this entire incident is being fully investigated.

Derek Montgomery for NPR This week the podcast and show Invisibilia examines the nature of reality, with a Silicon Valley techie who created apps to randomize his life ; a psychologist who trains herself to experience the world like dogs do; and a wildlife biologist who thinks bears aren't dangerous. 
When you live in northern Minnesota, wildlife is usually no big deal. A giant bull moose casually strolled through our neighborhood in Duluth a couple summers ago, past screaming and slack-jawed kids at a nearby park. Wolves also have ventured into town, occasionally killing dogs that strayed too far from their owners. Deer are as common as flies, and I only seem to notice them when they jump out in front of my car.
But bears are different. I hadn't seen one in town, while driving or even at the zoo. So in 2012, when Minnesota Public Radio reporter Dan Kraker asked if I wanted to join him as he went out with wildlife biologist Lynn Rogers to find a bear, I jumped at the opportunity.

Derek Montgomery for NPR Dan was going to write a story about Rogers' work putting webcams in bear dens and radio collars on bears. That work is controversial; he argues that it's creating a priceless database on the animals' behavior. Others say that because he feeds bears and touches them, the bears become accustomed to humans and pose a danger to people who aren't accustomed to wild bears approaching them. (In 2014, the state Department of Natural Resources rescinded Rogers' permit to collar bears, citing complaints from local residents.)

National Security Comey Opening Statement For Senate Intelligence Hearing, Annotated James Comey's appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee is unlike any event on Capitol Hill in recent years — anticipated for weeks, the subject of huge national scrutiny and scheduled for wall-to-wall news coverage.
Politics Comey: Trump Asked For 'Loyalty,' Wanted Him to 'Let' Flynn Investigation 'Go' The committee posted Comey's opening statement online Wednesday afternoon. A careful pattern of expectations-management and narrative-shaping has sought to establish the parameters for what he probably will not say.
Politics The James Comey Saga, In Timeline Form Even so, the hearing may well live up to the hype.
Senators will have had a day to prepare detailed questions about Comey's public opening statement.
Democrats want to tease out more information. Republicans want to knock holes in Comey's story.
For example:
Comey confirms President Trump's claim that he was not ""personally"" under investigation by the FBI — but what does ""personally"" mean, and was that only true at the time or is it so now? Comey does not detail every conversation he and Trump had — why not, and what did he omit from his statement? Did Comey's fellow intelligence agency bosses ever ask him to back off the Flynn investigation? When Trump asked Comey to lay off Flynn, did Comey understand that Trump was asking him to leave Flynn alone just over allegedly lying to Vice President Pence — or the other, earlier potential transgressions he might have committed? ""I am hopeful that he will clarify for the American people recent events that have been broadly reported in the media,"" Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., said when he announced the session.
The panel's vice chairman, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., says it's an opportunity for Comey to respond to the ""disparagement"" he has endured from Trump, who reportedly told Russian guests at the Oval Office the day after the firing that Comey was a ""nut job."" 
It's also a chance for an appearance by Comey the raconteur, the teller of memorable tales. He held Washington spellbound with his now-famous story about racing to the sickbed of then-Attorney General John Ashcroft when the White House wanted to lean on him to reauthorize a surveillance program.
On Thursday, the former FBI director has at least two scenes to unfold, according to his opening statement. First, Comey at a private dinner for two with Trump in the White House at which the president asked him for his ""loyalty.""
""It turned out to be just the two of us, seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room,"" Comey wrote. ""Two Navy stewards waited on us, only entering the room to serve food and drinks.""
Or Comey seated in a meeting in the Oval Office — then Trump asking everyone else to leave the room for a private request: ""I hope you can let this go.""
National Security Intelligence Chiefs Decline To Discuss Private Talks With Trump Comey's onetime fellow spy bosses were not forthcoming on Wednesday before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers declined to detail their private conversations with Trump in an open hearing .
Neither a law school clinic on witness-questioning from Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., nor a thunderous demand by Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, for the legal justification for their non-answers got the two intelligence bosses to budge.
""I stand by my previous answer,"" Rogers repeated.
Republican allies of Trump touted the answers that Coats and Rogers gave about never feeling ""pressure"" to lay off Flynn or the inquiry into potential connections between Trump's camp and Russia's meddling in the election last year.
Comey, however, does describe repeated requests and feelings of ""concern.""
So the demand among senators Thursday for Comey to elaborate on his written statement and the past accounts in The Washington Post and The New York Times may prove intense.
At least one important player said he was pleased by Comey's account.
Marc Kasowitz, the outside lawyer representing President Trump and to whom the White House has been referring questions regarding the Russia investigation, released a statement on Wednesday evening hailing Comey's account.
""The president is pleased that Mr. Comey has finally publicly confirmed his private reports that the president was not under investigation in any Russian probe,"" Kasowitz said. ""The president feels completely and totally vindicated. He is eager to continue to move forward with his agenda.""
On the other hand, Comey's friend Benjamin Wittes of the blog Lawfare posted an analysis of the prepared opening statement on Wednesday that took a different interpretation about what Comey did and did not say.
""Despite this sparseness,"" he wrote, ""or maybe I should say because of it, it is the most shocking single document compiled about the official conduct of the public duties of any president since the release of the Watergate tapes.""",Ex-FBI Director James Comey Testifies On Capitol Hill Thursday.

This week the podcast and show Invisibilia examines the nature of reality, with a Silicon Valley techie who created apps to randomize his life ; a wildlife biologist who thinks bears aren't dangerous; and a psychologist who trains herself to experience the world like dogs do . 
Noses are the unsung feature of the face, sunscreened or surgically fixed, but rarely exalted. And the sense they enable, smelling, is likewise uncelebrated. Regularly voted the ""sense I'd be most willing to lose"", olfaction is largely ignored — unless it brings word of something savory or foul nearby. 
But we are born smellers. After being enveloped while in the womb in the smell of our mother and the foods she ingested, babies emerge macrosmatic, keen-smelling. They find the mother's nipple and recognize their parents by scent. Children can identify their siblings and friends by smell. In those earliest sniffings, smelling is all about discovery and navigation. 
Gradually, though, we forsake our noses. What have you smelled today? Perhaps a half-dozen odors, mostly likely food or manufactured fragrance, or maybe one. Or none. Over the same period, your dog has sniffed his way out of sleep, come to examine your smell in the morning, busily investigated the smell leavings from the night before on your walk outside, and may have found his way to his fellow canines by scent. Reality Check 
What happens when people can't agree on reality? Alix Spiegel and co-host Hanna Rosin examine how two people can look at the same thing and experience two different emotions in the second episode of Season 3 of the NPR podcast Invisibilia . 
We admire the dog's olfactory acuity, and we should: dogs have hundreds of millions more olfactory receptors, the cells at the back of the nose that grab odors out of the air, than we do. They have two dedicated, separate routes in their snouts for sniffing and breathing; they have elaborate bones in their nose that hold yet more olfactory tissue; they even exhale out the side slits of their nostrils in order not to disturb the odors coming in. And as the performance of dogs that do tracking, search-and-rescue, and other detection tasks, they can use their highly sensitive olfactory instruments to locate substances that we never even thought had an odor: cancerous cells; minute quantities of TNT; the day-old footprint left by a missing person. 
All is not lost for us humans, though. We have the equipment, and, while not as varied or extensive as the dogs', it works perfectly well. Last month John McGann, an Associate Professor at Rutgers, published a review in Science last month reminding us that humans do, after all, have an olfactory bulb, and Swedish professor Matthias Laska has extensively demonstrated that in detecting some odors, such as amyl acetate (which smells like banana), we are plenty sensitive. Our experience of the flavor of food is mostly due to smell, experienced through the back of the mouth — retronasal olfaction — instead of through the nostrils. 
Knowing all this, I recently embarked on a project culminating in my book Being a Dog: Following the Dog into a World of Smell, in which I tried to improve my sense of smell by following the dog's lead, as well as that of some olfactory experts, among them a perfumer, a sommelier, and a pair of animal trackers. Dogs excepted, few of these experts were born noses. I learned that a few simple steps can change your nose from neglected to noticed, as it had for them: 
Stick your nose in it. Consider a dog's daily behavior, and contrast it with the frequency with which you see a person with nose smashed against a surface, inhaling calmly and confidently. Simply getting closer to a source and bravely sniffing will bring more odor molecules into our noses. Subscribe to Invisibilia 
Get over it. In the U.S., at least, our culture is a discourager of smells. The baby who notices an interesting smell? Her parents ignore her. Eventually, she will think of smells in a mostly binary way, as lovely or horrible. By contrast, experts in smelling view odors merely as information, not intrinsically good or bad, just as the images that we see tell us about our world. Treat scents like sights and it becomes easier to smell. 
Name the source. Once you start bringing your attention to what you smell, you may be at a loss for words: English doesn't have much of a vocabulary for smells. So olfactory experts create their own jargon. You can adopt theirs, but consider, too, our smell memories: The scent of cedar mixed with tobacco that floods me with memories of my father's desk; a whiff of pencil shavings, zipping me back to learning cursive in my third grade classroom. Find your own language, images or memories to represent the smell, and in so doing it will be easier to invoke the next time you sniff it. 
Even after spending months learning how to smell like a dog, observing detection dog training, following truffle dogs, and accompanying my own dog train in the sport of ""nose work"", I feel certain: I don't experience the world my dog does. But my own world is changed: It smells. And by smelling intentionally instead of just letting smells happen to me, odors have lost their simplicity. 
I'm glad to smell my family and friends. I know the smell of the afternoon in my office, warmed by sun, as well as the smell of the advent of spring. Before opening my eyes on awakening this morning, I could smell that the dogs and cat had joined me in bed, but my husband was up. In the next hour, I smelled mown grass and a waft of cloves in the park; the mustiness of a raincoat taken out of a back closet; when the toast was ready; and the beautiful, straw-like smell of the top of my son's head. I relish it all. ",People Can Learn To Use Their Sense Of Smell Like A Dog Does : Shots - Health News : NPR,normal,8a23723eb3a268f6eb454a1f5cede2563e09f263

The big three investigations are being run by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the House Intelligence Committee and the Department of Justice special counsel Robert Mueller. 
Here's a primer to help you sort out which investigation is doing what. Senate Intelligence Committee 
What is it focusing on? 
The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is conducting a broad inquiry looking at what, exactly, Russia did to influence the 2016 elections and how that fits into broader ""cyberactivity and active measures "" the country has used to target the United States. Part of that includes examining whether there is any evidence that members of Donald Trump's campaign collaborated with Russian operatives. 
""The Committee will follow the intelligence wherever it leads,"" Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Vice Chair Mark Warner, D-Va., said in a statement announcing the probe. 
""We will be conducting the bulk of the Committee's business behind closed doors because we take seriously our obligation to protect sources and methods."" 
Key players 
The panel is being led by Burr. He advised the Trump campaign last year but has vowed to take the investigation seriously. ""It overrides any personal beliefs that I have or loyalties that I might have,"" he told reporters earlier this year. 
Burr has separated himself from the Trump administration more than other key Republicans involved in Russia investigations. He voiced concerns about Comey's firing and has said he has seen no evidence backing one of Trump's more outlandish claims — that President Barack Obama ordered a ""wiretap"" of Trump Tower during the presidential campaign. 
Warner is the top Democrat on the committee. While the House Intelligence Committee has been characterized by partisan infighting, Warner has worked hard to present a united front with Burr. The two-term senator and former governor has repeatedly said the investigation is the ""most important thing I've ever done"" in public service. 
The Senate Intelligence Committee has several members who are often speculated about as future presidential candidates: Republicans Marco Rubio of Florida and Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Democrat Kamala Harris of California. 
Most memorable public moment 
The Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation has, up until this point, been defined by its bipartisan nature. 
That is due in part not only to inevitable comparisons to the often-gridlocked House Intelligence Committee's investigation but also to a concerted effort being made by Burr and Warner. 
Most of the Senate investigation's meetings and hearings have taken place behind closed doors. Comey's testimony before the panel will most assuredly be its most high-profile moment. But up until now, the Senate investigation's key characteristic has been the fact that Warner and Burr are, by and large, on the same page when it comes to the focus and pace of their investigation. 
What the investigation could lead to 
Burr and Warner have said their goal is to produce a detailed, bipartisan report summing up what actions Russian operatives took in 2016 and how similar attacks can be prevented in future elections. 
The committee can't recommend criminal charges, as the special counsel investigation is empowered to do. House Intelligence Committee 
What is it focusing on? 
Like its Senate counterpart, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence wants to write a report answering four questions: What did Russia do to influence the 2016 election? Were there any links between Russian operatives ""and individuals associated with political campaigns""? How did the federal government respond to these efforts? How and why was classified information leaked during this process? 
Chairman Devin Nunes and other Republicans on the committee have publicly focused much of their attention on leaks and whether the Obama administration "" unmasked "" intelligence about Trump associates for political purposes. 
Key players 
California Republican Nunes remains chair of the House Intelligence Committee, though in April, he temporarily stepped down as head of its Russia investigation. Nunes' move came in response to an Ethics Committee inquiry into whether he improperly disclosed classified information over the course of the investigation. 
The ethics probe was launched after Nunes made a high-profile trip to the White House to discuss information that he claimed raised questions about whether the Obama administration had improperly ""unmasked"" — or asked for the identity of — Trump associates surveilled during routine foreign intelligence operations. He spoke to reporters about this information before telling his colleagues on the committee about it. ""The committee has been put into suspended animation,"" Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., told MSNBC afterwards. 
Nunes later admitted that his information had initially come from the Trump administration. That raised questions about whether Nunes was providing political cover for the president he was investigating. 
While Nunes stepped down from the Russia investigation, he has continued to issue and sign investigation-related subpoenas. 
Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, is leading the Russia investigation in Nunes' place. 
California Rep. Adam Schiff is the top Democrat on the committee and one of the most commonly seen public faces of the Russia inquiries. 
As the committee's investigation became more partisan, Schiff was forthright not just with the available evidence of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia — but also with what it would mean if such a thing were proven true. 
""Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated, and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence? Yes, it is possible. But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated, and that the Russians used the same techniques to corrupt U.S. persons that they have employed in Europe and elsewhere. We simply don't know, not yet, and we owe it to the country to find out,"" Schiff said at a March hearing featuring Comey and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers. 
Conaway and Schiff tried to repair public confidence in the bipartisan integrity of their investigation by making a joint press statement on Tuesday. 
Most memorable public moment 
Nunes' White House trips created weeks of headlines. But the committee's public hearings have led to several key moments, as well. 
The most notable: Comey's first public disclosure of an active FBI probe into whether anyone on Trump's campaign colluded with Russian efforts to influence the election. 
What it could lead to 
The House Intelligence Committee's end goal is a report laying out its findings. Like the Senate committee, the House investigation wouldn't lead to criminal charges. 
The key question is whether the House Intelligence Committee will issue one bipartisan report or two separate findings from its Republican and Democratic camps. Special Counsel, Department Of Justice 
What is it focusing on? 
On May 17, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Mueller to take charge of the FBI investigation into whether anyone on Trump's campaign colluded with Russian operatives. 
This is the leading Russia investigation but also the most secretive. While the House and Senate committees play out in high-profile public hearings, Mueller's investigation will take place behind closed doors. Congressional investigations also tend to defer to law enforcement when it comes to access to witnesses and evidence. 
Muller is charged with investigating ""any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Campaign of President Donald Trump; and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation."" 
That second clause has been interpreted to include the question of whether Trump or other White House officials improperly acted to impede the FBI investigation and likely includes the circumstances of the dismissals of both former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Comey . 
Key players 
Mueller led the FBI for 12 years and began his tenure just a week before the Sept. 11 terror attacks. He's widely respected in Washington. 
Other key members of Mueller's investigative team include former FBI Chief of Staff Aaron Zebley; onetime Watergate prosecutor James Quarles; Andrew Weissmann, who led the Department of Justice's fraud division and helped investigate Enron; and Jeannie Rhee, who worked in the Justice Department, as well as Mueller's law firm WilmerHale. 
Most memorable public moment 
Over the course of his career, Mueller developed a reputation as someone who does not leak to the news media. So we don't know too much about how the investigation is going. 
So the most memorable moment of the investigation is probably Rosenstein's surprise announcement that he was appointing Mueller to begin with. 
What it could lead to 
Special counsel investigations into White Houses are notoriously unpredictable. Ken Starr's probe into Bill and Hillary Clinton's alleged real estate improprieties led to a report about Bill Clinton's extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky and the president's eventual impeachment. 
The investigation into whether the Bush White House improperly leaked the name of CIA operative Valerie Plame ultimately led to a top White House aide, Scooter Libby, being convicted of obstruction of justice and perjury. 
The key detail here is that Mueller has the power to press criminal charges based on what his investigation uncovers. And his investigation is likely to have broader scope and intensity than the congressional committees, so its findings could have political ramifications as well. And the rest... 
While those are the three most high-profile Russia investigations, there are various other inquiries in different parts of the federal government. Those include: The Senate Armed Services Committee, led by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has been tasked with looking for ways to improve cybersecurity and protect against future hacking by foreign actors. The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, led by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., held the hearing at which former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified that she had warned the Trump White House that she believed Flynn was ""compromised."" The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has been looking at Flynn's payments from Russia and Turkey . Ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings of Maryland has largely driven the narrative on that angle, releasing evidence at various times. The committee also joined the Senate Judiciary Committee, with oversight of the FBI, and the Senate Intelligence Committee in requesting copies of Comey's memos detailing private interactions with Trump. The Department of Defense Inspector General is also investigating Flynn's payments from Russia and Turkey to determine whether those payments broke laws against former officers receiving foreign payments without advance approval. The House Financial Services Committee's Democratic members have been requesting documents from Deutsche Bank to investigate whether Trump has been given any loans backed by Russian interests.

This week, the podcast and show Invisibilia examines the nature of reality, with a Silicon Valley techie who created apps to randomize his life, a psychologist who trains herself to experience the world like dogs do and a wildlife biologist who thinks bears aren't dangerous. 
In San Francisco, the life Max Hawkins lived was arguably perfect. 
He was employed by Google, surrounded by friends and had his routine nailed down. He woke to artisanal coffee, biked to work along the beautiful Embarcadero waterfront roadway, lunched on Google's famed free food (""like four different kinds of kale"" level) and — possibly the true mark of a successful millennial — got invited to many happy hours. 
But something was missing. 
Sometimes Max would lay awake at night pondering what felt so ... wrong. 
""I just started thinking about these loops that we get into,"" he says. ""And about how the structure of your life ... completely determines what happens in it."" 
Max's once beautiful routine suddenly seemed unfulfilling. He felt like he was growing closer to people in his own bubble and becoming isolated from those outside of it. 
""There was something ... that just made me feel trapped,"" he says. ""Like I was reading a story that I'd read before or I was playing out someone else's script."" Reality Check 
How is it that two people can look at the same thing and see something completely different? Alix Spiegel and co-host Hanna Rosin tackle the notion of bubbles and follow two people making radical attempts to break out of them in the latest episode of Season 3 of the NPR podcast Invisibilia . 
As any computer developer would do, Max turned to technology to craft his way out — a series of randomization applications. 
Max started small, with an app that integrated Uber. It starts like a regular ride-hailing app: He would press a button in the app and a car would arrive. But then, a twist: He couldn't select a drop-off location; the app would choose a spot within a range without disclosing it. The only thing the rider had to do was enjoy the journey — and hope for a good destination. 
From there, Max's applications became more complex. He built an app that used a Facebook search function for public events to find ones near him. Then the app would randomly choose which event Max would attend. 
At first, he was nervous: What if people wouldn't let him in? But, as a kind of unassuming white guy, he actually didn't have this problem. (And Max acknowledges this privilege.) Once Max explained how and why he had arrived at these events, hosts usually welcomed him, often with only a few questions asked. Most of the time, people were taken by the idea of Max expanding his bubble. 
One night, he got to drink white Russians with some Russians. Another, he attended acroyoga (as in, acrobatics + yoga). A community center pancake breakfast. A networking event for young professionals. The algorithm chose; Max attended. 
Most of these events were something that the nonrandomized Max would never have thought to try. The computer was breaking him out of a life driven by his own preferences. He was suddenly seeing the world in a whole new way, and he really liked it. 
For two years, Hawkins let his app guide him around the globe, including a stop in Gortina, Slovenia. Courtesy of Max Hawkins hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Max Hawkins For two years, Hawkins let his app guide him around the globe, including a stop in Gortina, Slovenia. Courtesy of Max Hawkins 
""If I went out myself and said, like, 'I want to see the world!' I have an idea of what I need to see to do that,"" Max says. ""But when I'm turning that over to a random algorithm, it has its own different idea. You're taking on the computer's view of the world, and because that's not human, it's likely to be completely different from your own."" 
One year, Max decided to use the Facebook-event generator app to choose where he would celebrate Christmas. It came up with a party at someone's home in Fresno, Calif. 
With a pie and a friend, Max drove for three hours and showed up on the doorstep of a retired psychologist, Karena Beasley. Karena was celebrating with a handful of friends and family — and now, also two 20-something strangers. 
""She was completely not fazed,"" Max says, describing the moment they met Karena. ""She didn't miss a beat. She said, 'Oh, wonderful! We love Facebook, I'm so glad you're at the party. Welcome.' And it was like instantly we were friends."" 
Max says he and his friend stayed at the party for five or six hours. In a video from the night, the group sings carols to guitar and Max looks as if he is right where he belongs. 
Max lived a randomized life for the better part of two years. In fact, he went global. He created an app that chose the places he would live, travel and eat.

Trump's attempt to latch on to the fact Comey told him the FBI was not investigating him personally in a counter-intelligence investigation and if some of his campaign people did something wrong he's innocent is grasping at straws.
One, the FBI never is personally investigating the head of an organization they're investigating the organization and it's underlings until they can roll them up and then include the head of that organization.

Securely understanding this notion, Solange recently used iambic melodies of her album, , to transform the Guggenheim into a space of healing for Black and Brown women.
The modern performance artist willed the space into a christened white palace, requesting that all fans wear white to her meditative experience so that she could see the faces of the people who inspired her latest body of work more clearly.
She had one more demand: no phones or cameras. She wanted her supporters to bask in the experience.
Fans dressed in ivory tones sat on the floor of the museum, while press and musicians such as Bjork, Zoe Kravitz and Questlove prepared for the performance on the second and third layer of the spiral ramp.
Spectators of the show looked as if they were attending a wedding or a baptism. Suddenly, four men disrupted the crowd of white by approaching the stage wearing outspoken yellow, burgundy and electric blue color-blocked jumpsuits. Members of the audience began to clap their hands as the four men drew their instruments to interrupt the noise around them.
A trumpet summoned the start of the show, “Solange: An Ode to,” sponsored by the Red Bull Music Academy.
Solange and her two background singers started the performance at highest peak of the circular ramp. They walked the slope barefooted in tan matching sport outfits. The trio marched down, surrounded by eight dancers dressed in white garments.

The throng of diverse dancers dressed in similar colors, all sporting different hairstyles and different hair colors. The ensemble’s crisp movements resembled soldiers marching to reclaim a familiar space. As they glided by spectators there was surprising silence as many stretched for a quick glance at Solange.
Once she hit the ground floor of the museum the show started to the tune of “Rise.”
This set the ton for the themes of self-love, inclusivity, connectivity and simplicity -- with Solange performing near white geometric sculptures.
Next was the song “Weary,” a soft tune that reminds fans to consistently question the world around them. Solange incorporated simplistic dance moves into the performance of her melodies, tapping her chest and sides creating her own personal beat.
A photo posted by NBC News (@nbcnews)
The singer’s bodily movements often changed as she transitioned songs.
Solange then performed a new version of her song, “Mad,” an anthem that highlights the frustrations of Black individuals due to racism. She displayed her rage by screaming in a way that communicated both anger and deep pain. She then dramatically moved her body uncontrollably, falling to the floor kicking and screaming, almost resembling a woman at church catching the Holy Ghost.
When it was time for her anthem “F.U.B.U.,” an empowerment song for people of color, her performance became more placid. Solange interlocked her hands and swung them in a circular motion, imitating the movements of a soulful reggae singer.
The artist took her performance a step further by walking into the crowd and physically connecting with the audience, touching the shoulders of one of her fans as she sang the lyrics softly. When she happened to identify a Black security guard in the midst, she approached him and pointed at him as she rocked and sang to him. Fans screamed when the singer hopped away from the security guard and started twerking as her band continued to play.
Solange’s older sister Beyoncé has been called the biggest star in the world by many. However, Queen Bey is arguably so big that she is unreachable to most her fans, following only eight individuals back on Twitter.
The candidness displayed at Solange’s show is not unique behavior. The Grammy winner consistently communicates with her fans on social media. When she asks them to create things for her, the entertainer’s fans loyally deliver.
“My twitter fingers almost got the best of me this morning,” Solange said that evening at her show.
Although Solange has experienced great success in 2016 with her third album, debuting at number one on Billboard charts and winning the Grammy for Best R&B Performance for her hit single “Cranes in the Sky,” it’s clear that Solange enjoys intimately connecting with her fans.
She has opted to perform in small venues, where she could literally touch her supporters, look them in the eyes and sing to them. Subtly showing that nothing is more important to her than uniting with the people she creates her music for.
After performing ""F.U.B.U"" Solange covered Stevie Wonder’s ex-wife, Syreeta Wright’s song, “Black Maybe,” a mellow tune that highlights difficulties that Black males encounter due to racism.

Knowles ended her show performing, “Don’t Touch My Hair,” a song that audaciously rejects the practice of touching Black women hair without their consent. As Solange sang, the ensemble of musicians who had been hidden from view emerged, playing trumpets and saxophones.
After the performance, Solange and her dancers formed two lines and executed a choreographic move in which they slanted their bodies like surfers and pointed their hands directly at members of the audience. Fans assumed this symbolized the end of the show, with the band playing the melodies of “Rise” and the dancers running off stage.
Solange then ran up the stairs of the Guggenheim as fans cheered. To the surprise of many, she ran back down and delivered a speech, first thanking her supporters for allowing her to grow. She explained that she wanted to show the world what Black women could do when they are given access to prominent established spaces.
She told the crowd that although she was performing in the Guggenheim, she did not care much about institutions. As she put it, she works hard to “tear the ‘cot damn’ walls down.”",Solange Brings Unapologetic Blackness to the Guggenheim - NBC News,normal,e9a814d0b4cfadf529ea79908331926835167d43

There are some very cool projects going on in spider science these days. 
In one study, jumping spiders are induced to climb small viewing towers to contemplate experimentally manipulated images of prey. In another, wolf spiders are invited to assess visual and vibratory signals, digitally altered in various ways, that represent qualities of their potential mating partners. 
Innovative methods are being used to ask the question, ""What goes on in the mind of spiders?"" The results suggest that the answer is ""quite a lot."" 
Fiona Cross and Robert Jackson at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand discovered that jumping spiders of the species Portia africana display a sort of numerical competence. 
Cross and Jackson's paper in the journal Interface Focus , from the Royal Society, explains that these spiders of the family salticidae , which hunt other spiders for food, were ""proficient at distinguishing between numbers of prey in the range of 1-3, but apparently not proficient at making the discriminations 3 versus 4 or 3 versus 6."" A Spider Across The Room Can 'Hear' You, Study Finds 
How that conclusion relates to mental representation , the ability to hold symbols or images in the mind about one's world, is the most intriguing part of this research. 
Cross and Jackson set the spiders up with two towers, with little viewing screens at each. At the first (the starting tower), the spiders saw scenes of prey from the genus Argyrodes — also spiders — that they quite commonly eat. 
""As the number of Argyrodes individuals in a single web tends to be highly variable,"" Cross and Jackson write, ""this particular prey might especially often present Portia with situations in which numerical cognition would be relevant."" 
At the second tower (the viewing tower), the spiders saw a different number of the same kind of prey.(In the control trials, they saw the same number.) 
The spiders' behavior in the experimental trials showed evidence of ""expectancy violation"" — that is, their behavior differed in terms of movement and timing between the two towers in ways that suggested they didn't see at the second tower what they thought they were going to see. 
The spiders, for example, looked longer at the second tower when the prey number displayed there differed from the number at the first tower — echoing (in broad outline) what happened when a similar approach was used in earlier research with a variety of nonhuman primates . 
Here's how Cross and Jackson explain their key finding: 
""We propose that, while on the Starting Tower, the test spider loaded a representation of prey number into working memory and that, while on the Viewing Tower, it compared the Scene it was viewing with a representation of the Scene acquired while on the Starting Tower."" 
What terrific spider science! It tells us something truly interesting about these jumping spiders, beloved to many including as pets, I recently learned. 
""How an animal with such a small nervous system can do all this should keep us awake at night,"" Cross and Jackson told Joshua Sokol in May's Quanta Magazine . 
George Uetz of the University of Cincinnati, and his co-authors Brent Stoffer, Madeline Lallo and David Clark, are equally impressed with their own spider study subjects, wolf spiders, Schizocosa ocreata. Uetz's team published an article in March in Animal Behaviour showing that female wolf spiders respond in complex ways to signals emitted by males that are potential mating partners. 
Uetz and his colleagues tested female spiders using a playback method, where the females saw on video a range of digitally altered visual signals related to males' leg tuft size, or, via a substrate, felt vibratory signals related to amplitude in the males. The signals were presented either alone or in different combinations. 
I asked Uetz by email to discuss the significance of the results. He replied, in part, this way: 
""By using both vibratory and visual playback techniques, we demonstrated that females showed ordered preferences for males with louder vibratory signals and larger visual signals — both when each modality was isolated and when presented as a full multimodal signal. 
However, female preference changed based on which males were simultaneously presented, suggesting that comparative evaluation of alternatives is a factor in decision making by this species."" 
Spiders make decisions! Of course, I already knew that on some level; it has been clear to me for a while that spiders and many insects don't act based only on instinct but, instead, probe their world by learning things and thinking in some way about them. 
But this pair of experiments brings the point home sharply, as Uetz underscored for me regarding his wolf-spider experiments: 
""Interestingly, when conflicting cues were presented alone, females weighed them equally, but when given a choice (conflicting cues presented simultaneously), females weighted the visual signal more heavily. Thus, the presentation context affected their relative preference, suggesting that comparative evaluation of alternatives is involved."" 
Uetz told me that his whole team is: 
""impressed that these tiny animals have far more capacity for complex (and subtle) communication and decision-making abilities than we ever gave them credit for. Given the plasticity of responses we have seen in these (and other) experimental studies, I suspect some level of cognition must be involved."" 
Cognitive spiders: We're finding out amazing things about them all the time — like how jumping spiders can hear us from across the room. ",What Goes On In the Minds Of Spiders? : 13.7: Cosmos And Culture : NPR,normal,1930bdc6d44b99578643c0dea1ffad8809a20631

As lead singer of Gossip , Beth Ditto strutted and sang with the presence of a powerhouse. But as that band's career wound down last year — its last album, the commercially underperforming A Joyful Noise , came out in 2012 — it seemed mired in an identity crisis. Gossip's brash, soulfully combative rock 'n' roll had become softer and slicker, and while that left turn suited a band that thrived on surprises, it disappointed many fans who'd come to expect swaggering dance-punk with sharper teeth. 
Beth Ditto, Fake Sugar. Courtesy of artist hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of artist 
Five years after A Joyful Noise , Ditto returns with Fake Sugar , a solo debut that polishes her sound further. But it also benefits greatly from a shift in expectations: Freed of some of the hype surrounding Gossip's earlier records, it recasts Ditto as a versatile, pop-minded rock star who can still shake the rafters with her voice when the moment calls for it. Given the singer's gift for stage theatrics — she helped make Gossip's live shows legendary — it's easy to imagine these songs performed amid pyrotechnic displays worthy of Lady Gaga . 
More importantly, Fake Sugar stays surprising throughout, with Ditto rarely bothering to tread the same ground twice: ""Fire"" churns and preens with Southern-rock self-assuredness before giving way to the sweetly shimmering girl-group choruses of ""In And Out"" and the ingratiatingly smooth softness of the title track. Elsewhere, ""Oo La La"" lands with stomping force, while ""We Could Run"" soars heavenward with a chorus that conjures memories of Enrique Iglesias' for-the-ages pop anthem "" Escape ."" 
It's become standard procedure to look askance at underground artists who take big swings at stardom. But if Beth Ditto becomes a full-blown mainstream star — as a queer plus-sized outspoken feminist with her own fashion line — it'll come at the expense of every norm she's spent her career working to tear down. Fake Sugar may be just the Trojan horse she needs.

Shawn Brackbill It's been six years since Fleet Foxes released Helplessness Blues , a sonically and thematically expansive take on what it's like to feel adrift and anxious in a world that seems to be breaking apart around us. On Crack-Up , singer-songwriter Robin Pecknold follows those ideas to their logical conclusion: After a long foray into academia, he's opted to slow down, settle in and craft an album that takes its time the way he's taken his.
Fleet Foxes, Crack-Up. Courtesy of artist hide caption 
toggle caption Courtesy of artist Fleet Foxes' music has long sought a strange and distinct balance of finely detailed introspection and cavernousness: No matter how audaciously Pecknold's voice radiates heavenward, and no matter how ambitiously his arrangements sprawl out to form suites, his songs still conjure the sensation of withdrawing into one's own doubt-stricken head. On Crack-Up , listening can entail following a complex train of thought, as Pecknold meanders and shape-shifts through many points within lengthy songs that double as medleys — most notably in the album-opening ""I Am All That I Need/Arroyo Seco/Thumbprint Scar"" and the nearly nine-minute single ""Third Of May/Odaigahara.""
Crack-Up is enveloping enough to get lost in, and it doesn't always offer easy entry points. For every contained and elegantly pretty ballad like ""Kept Woman,"" there's a byzantine engine of ambition like the title track, which closes Crack-Up with a burst of energy worthy of its title. But the point never gets lost that these songs chronicle the pursuit of contentment, however frustrated — and take great care to linger in the beauty that crops up along the way.

Chad Batka/Courtesy of Artist hide caption toggle caption Steve Earle's new album, So You Wannabe an Outlaw, is out June 16. Chad Batka/Courtesy of Artist 
Steve Earle has always kept at least a foothold in his outlaw country roots, but he's seldom embraced them as explicitly as he does on So You Wannabe an Outlaw . Over the past couple of years, Earle's been enmeshed in specialized projects — the 2015 bluesman's holiday Terraplane Blues and 2016's covers-heavy duo album with Shawn Colvin. But a tour last year to commemorate the 30 th birthday of his landmark debut album, Guitar Town , and some time spent reconnecting with key early influences like Waylon Jennings' Honky Tonk Heroes and Willie Nelson's Phases and Stages helped put Earle back in an outlaw state of mind. 
Back when a 19-year-old Earle abandoned his native Texas for Nashville, there wasn't a better place for a rebellious country songwriter's apprenticeship. Waylon and co. were making their raw, revolutionary mid-'70s records, and troubadours like Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt (the latter the subject of a 2009 tribute album by Earle) were adding their game-changing brand of songpoetry to the mix. Assimilating all those influences, Earle became the standard-bearer for a new kind of country maverick in the second half of the '80s, when alt country didn't exist and most of the soul was being systematically sucked out of the Music City mainstream. 
He's remained true to that renegade spirit ever since, and it was that same iconoclasm that drove him to various genre-hopping experiments over the years, from blues to bluegrass and beyond. But as Earle puts his early inspirations in tight focus, So You Wannabe an Outlaw is the sound of a man honing in on his wheelhouse and bashing one out of the park. 
Steve Earle, So You Wannabe an Outlaw. Courtesy of artist hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of artist 
Waylon's signature growling Telecaster tone is a sonic touchstone for this album, and it's at the heart of the title track's cautionary tale, an overt homage to Jennings' ""Waymore Blues"" that includes an appropriately gritty guest vocal from Willie himself. The phaser effect that was a crucial component of Waylon's sound is summoned up by Earle on the roughneck stomp ""Looking for a Woman,"" a gun-shy post-breakup narrative that's tempting to read as the aftermath of Earle's 2014 split from wife Allison Moorer. 
It seems like Earle's been reading up on his firefighting history for the rugged two-stepper ""The Firebreak Line."" Its forest fireman narrative revolves around the heroic deeds of real-life forest ranger Ed Pulaski during the Great Idaho Fire of 1910. But there's nothing heroic about the narrator of the ferocious ""Fixin' to Die."" Fueled by a guitar assault far nastier and more rocking than anything Waylon ever attempted, it follows a cuckold's journey from fatal retribution to the last mile. 
But while the first half of the album is heavily front-loaded with snarling hard-chargers, the subtler side of Earle's vision is given more room on the second half. Written and sung with Miranda Lambert, ""This Is How It Ends"" is a bittersweet look at the unwinding of a marriage, a topic that both Earle and Lambert know a bit about. ""You Broke My Heart"" sidles up to the same subject, but with an old-school, acoustic-based front-porch feel. ""Walkin' In L.A."" taps into a pre-outlaw vibe, too, with its classic Ray Price-style shuffle, sweetly sawing fiddle licks, and a vocal assist from '60s honky-tonk hero Johnny Bush (who once played in Price's band). 
The album's closing cut, ""Goodbye Michelangelo,"" simultaneously brings to mind beginnings and endings. The mournful acoustic ballad is an elegy for Guy Clark, who passed away in 2016. Besides pointing the way toward new paths in country in the '70s, Clark was one of the young Earle's most important mentors in Nashville, and the latter's sense of loss is palpable in his sorrowful but unsentimental farewell. Fortunately, Clark left behind a country music universe populated by a new breed of outlaws like Lambert, Sturgill Simpson and Chris Stapleton. But for all the eminence of Clark, Van Zandt, et al, the new school owes as much to Earle as anybody. In that sense, it's doubly significant to hear him saluting the lessons he learned at the feet of the outlaw masters.

Shervin Lainez/Courtesy of   Shervin Lainez/Courtesy of artist Palehound's new album, A Place I'll Always Go, is out June 16.
Shervin Lainez/Courtesy of artist An inexorable truth of life is that we all will lose someone close. Death is cruelly indifferent, and no matter how expected or seemingly random it is, no one is ever truly prepared when a loved one is all of sudden gone. Palehound's Ellen Kempner understands this as much as anyone. In relatively close succession last year, the Boston-based songwriter faced the unforeseen death of a friend, and the passing of her grandmother, and was left reeling as a result. Palehound's second full-length album, A Place I'll Always Go , cannot help but be informed by these experiences. Channeling her grief into honest songs about mortality and the search for closure, the album reveals details from her personal life like never before.
Palehound, A Place I'll Always Go. Courtesy of   Courtesy of artist On ""If You Met Her,"" a song about the lingering heartache felt by her friend's absence, Kempner recalls happy moments preserved as memories, and marking the time since she passed. ""Starting to count up to two / Another year of missing you / When the dust clears, where's my body?,"" she asks. She then flips the script with these final, devastating lines, ""I'm with someone new / And I know that you would love her / If you met her,"" she pines with a plaintive, breathy whisper. Elsewhere, Kempner confronts her past (""Turning 21""), and admits feigning happiness while unraveling within (""Silver Toaster""). In ""Flowing Over,"" she describes listening to sad music as a way to quell the anxiety attacks. ""Flowing over 'til I'm empty!,"" she shouts in a mantra that others might turn to during their own low moments.
Still, for all its rumination, the album gradually projects a flicker of light amid the darkness: During this same tumultuous time, Kempner found herself entering into her first healthy relationship. A Place I'll Always Go grapples not only with the contradictory flood of emotions and guilt that arise when attempting to move on, but with the burgeoning excitement of new love. In ""Room,"" Kempner both evokes the cloistered sanctuary of her newfound companionship and romance, and reflects a contentment and ease with her queer identity. ""Call us sinners but we eat all our dinners in my room... Rests her head near, I'm feeling OK here in my room,"" she sings atop a bed of jangling guitars and glistening keyboard hooks.
Recorded in late 2016 at Brooklyn's Thump Studios with assistance from Gabe Wax (who also worked on Palehound's superb 2015 album, Dry Food), A Place I'll Always Go galvanizes its bedroom confessionals with Kempner's dexterous finger-plucked arpeggios and buzzy guitar melodies, and the propulsive rocking energy of drummer Jesse Weiss and bassist Larz Brogan. Palehound adds richer instrumental shadings on the album's bookends: On the transportive opener, ""Hunter's Gun,"" loping electronic beats and ethereal guitars glide underneath the hushed vocals; in the closer, ""At Night I'm Alright With You,"" eschews guitar for a stark synth hum and scratchy pulse that blossoms into bliss as she sings ""But at night I'm alright with you,"" with a sense of calming reprieve.
Kempner ultimately finds that without pain, there's no joy. You can deny your grief or push it down deep, but the only relief comes when you let it be felt, and derive strength from your vulnerabilities. While the arc of A Place I'll Always Go may have initially begun in the wake of tremendous loss, Palehound's unflinching songs are also a celebration of life and embrace of love, and an empathetic reflection on how endings usually lead to beginnings.

Royal Trux, Platinum Tips + Ice Cream. Courtesy of   Courtesy of artist Really, Royal Trux is for all occasions, and we should all be so lucky that Neil Hagerty and Jennifer Herrema are back to steer rock 'n' roll toward chaos once more. In its first run from 1987-2001, Royal Trux was the heir to the throne befouled by The Rolling Stones , The Stooges , Captain Beefheart and New York Dolls . But its scuzz was only matched by its surrealism, with perverse turns at every corner (do not Google the artwork for Sweet Sixteen while on the job or ever). But Royal Trux was too ugly to live, and when Hagerty and Herrema's romantic relationship went down the toilet (again, do not search for Sweet Sixteen , for the love of God), so did the band. He since formed The Howling Hex, she helmed RTX and Black Bananas, both flirting with and running far, far away from their old band's sound.
Platinum Tips + Ice Cream is the first release from Royal Trux in 17 years, culled from two live sets recently recorded in New York and Los Angeles. It is raw, unpolished and, according to the band, ""unrehearsed,"" with songs that span the band's catalog and deep cuts (but nothing from Sweet Sixteen , which... if you're gonna do it, just do it, OK? Remember: You wanted this.) It's not easy to return with (or recommend) a live rock 'n' roll record, but dammit, Platinum Tips is a hurling gut-punch of a document. Hagerty's guitar fuzz is thick and gelatinous, a blood-soaked ooze crusting at the edges, as Herrema howls, growls and gurgles in her own time signature. They're joined by bassist Brian McKinley and drummer Tim Barnes (The Tower Recordings, Text Of Light), both of whom have had run-ins with post-Royal Trux projects.
""Junkie Nurse"" and ""Esso Dame"" (from the self-titled LP) are prime trash-punk Trux, as Hagerty and Herrema stumble over each other like the words were always made-up and the riffs were always meant to be funkier. ""Sometimes"" is probably the most indicative of the alt-rock sprawl from which Trux never really sprang, but here it's far heavier and far meaner. Accelerator 's warped classic rock only gets one entry, and curiously it's ""The Banana Question,"" a pointedly dumb and repetitive riff bore into your skull at a sputtering El Camino speed. It all ends with ""Ice Cream"" from 1990's truly inscrutable Twin Infinitives , an album that took the lo-fi squall of The Velvet Underground 's White Light/White Heat and somehow made it weirder.
Will Royal Trux ever make new music? Maybe, maybe not. Platinum Tips + Ice Cream is a helpful ease back into its skewed world, but it also makes a convincing argument that Royal Trux's revisited and regurgitated repertoire in a wild and dangerous live setting could eclipse its catalog.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: 
Here in Washington D.C., several bars are opening early this morning, and former FBI Director James Comey will be up on the big-screen TVs there, testifying before the Senate intelligence committee. Comey's opening statement was released yesterday. And it gave us an early look at what Comey's going to say. The headline, Comey writes that the president asked him to promise loyalty and to ease off on the investigation into former national security adviser Mike Flynn. Philip Mudd will be watching the hearing closely, as will many others. He is a former intelligence officer for the CIA and the FBI.
Hey, Phil, thanks for being here this morning.
PHILIP MUDD: Thank you.
MARTIN: What stood out to you in Comey's written testimony?
MUDD: What wasn't said. There's a couple things that are missing here. The first is any suggestion that the commander in chief, that is the president, had a conversation with the FBI director about how to secure America for the next election. The conversation centers on how the president can protect himself in light of the allegations. But if you're sitting in the seat in the Oval Office, the first comment you should have is come over here under the guidance of the national security adviser and have a conversation about how we ensure this never happens again.
The second thing is also what's missing - the clarity about what the attorney general and the deputy attorney general were doing through all of this. There's way too much commentary that I have heard in the past half day about whether Jim Comey was timid or not. There's a second question. Why didn't somebody from the Department of Justice intervene directly with the president? They should have done that, and he should speak about that today.
MARTIN: Well, there is this criticism that if Comey was so disturbed by all of this, he should have gone directly to the attorney general right away, instead of just telling his inner circle at the FBI that he was made uncomfortable by these conversations with the president.
MUDD: I think that's correct. But you've got a couple of things to consider. First, he's concerned that the attorney general is already tarnished because of his previous relationship with the Russians during the campaign. And the second is it's not just on him to go to the attorney general. As soon as the attorney general knows that the president of the United States is asking for a one-on-one, private conversation with the FBI director in this environment, it should not be the FBI director's responsibility alone to go to the attorney general. I've
worked for three attorneys general at the FBI. Any one of them, I suspect, would have said, hey, Mr. FBI Director, what happened in there, and then would have gone to either the president or the chief of staff at the White House and said, you can't do this. It's not just on Comey.
MARTIN: You say that what's interesting to you is what wasn't communicated in Comey's version of these conversations. Why is that so telling, that the thrust of the conversations wasn't about the issues of Russian meddling, that it was centered on the president's behavior or the investigation into Mike Flynn and that that's a problem in and of itself?
MUDD: Every conversation we've had, or most of them in the past months, has been on the lurid stories about campaign involvement with the Russians. There's a profound question here that haunts this. It haunts me. What happens when we go into a next election cycle and we are not resolved on how to protect candidates and how to protect the American electoral process?
The president of the United States is not primarily responsible for infrastructure, for health care. He is the commander in chief. That's the primary responsibility when you walk in the Oval Office. And I cannot see an indication where this president has understood that responsibility.
MARTIN: In the seconds remaining, do you see - what Comey has laid out in these written statements, do you see an argument for obstruction of justice on the part of the president?
MUDD: I don't yet, and that's why conversations with others, including Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort, are important. This is inappropriate. I'm not sure it meets a legal standard for obstruction.
MARTIN: Philip Mudd is a former CIA counterintelligence official and a senior FBI intelligence adviser. Thanks so much for your time this morning.
MUDD: Thank you.

CBS News correspondent ... 
Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard indirectly blamed Saudi Arabia for the attacks. A statement issued Wednesday evening stopped short of alleging direct Saudi involvement but called it ""meaningful"" that the attacks followed Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, where he strongly asserted Washington's support for Riyadh. 
The statement said Saudi Arabia ""constantly supports"" terrorists including ISIS, adding that the ISIS claim of responsibility ""reveals (Saudi Arabia's) hand in this barbaric action."" 
The ""spilled blood of the innocent will not remain unavenged,"" the Revolutionary Guard statement said. 
Emirati Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash told The Associated Press on Wednesday that ""the Iranian government should not use the attack in a very polarized situation against Saudi Arabia or claim that Saudi Arabia is somehow linked to the attack, because it isn't."" 
Iranian state television reported the increase in the death toll to 16 on Thursday, citing Ahmad Shojaei, the head of the country's forensic center. He told state TV that ""three of the victims are women."" He did not elaborate. 
Iranian authorities have said assailants were Iranian nationals, adding they have arrested six suspects, including one woman, since the attack Wednesday in Tehran. 
On the streets of the capital Thursday, Iranians said they remained suspicious that Saudi Arabia had a hand in the attack. Some pointed to comments in May by Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the son of the King Salman and the kingdom's defense minister, who said his country would ""work so that it becomes a battle for them in Iran and not in Saudi Arabia."" 
""I am sure Persian Gulf Arab countries are behind this,"" said Nahid Ghanbari, a 21-year-old university student studying accounting. ""They have been angry about Iran's power in the region. They look for a way to destabilize our country."" 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's supreme leader, used the attacks to defend Tehran's involvement in wars abroad. He told a group of students that if ""Iran had not resisted,"" it would have faced even more troubles. 
""The Iranian nation will go forward,"" he added. 
The violence began in midmorning when assailants with Kalashnikov rifles and explosives stormed the parliament complex where a legislative session had been in progress. The siege lasted for hours, and one of the attackers blew himself up inside, according to Iran's state TV. 
Images circulating in Iranian media showed gunmen held rifles near the windows of the complex. One showed a toddler being handed through a first-floor window to safety outside as an armed man looked on. 
As the parliament attack unfolded, gunmen and suicide bombers also struck outside Khomeini's mausoleum on Tehran's southern outskirts. Khomeini led the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the Western-backed shah to become Iran's first supreme leader until his death in 1989. 
Iran's state broadcaster said a security guard was killed at the tomb and that one of the attackers was slain by security guards. A woman was also arrested. The revered shrine was not damaged. 
Police on Thursday said they now held six suspects as part of their investigation into the attacks. 
Reza Seifollahi, an official in the country's Supreme National Security Council, was quoted by Iranian media as saying that the perpetrators of the attacks were Iranian nationals. He did not elaborate.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: 
In Cincinnati yesterday, President Trump promoted the general idea of American infrastructure.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We are a nation that created the Panama Canal, the Transcontinental Railroad and the inter - if you think about this, the great highway system - the interstate highway system. We don't do that anymore.
INSKEEP: So what's he want to do about it? NPR's David Schaper reports the president left open two big issues - what to build and how to pay for it.
DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: The beautiful river city of Cincinnati, with its new downtown stadiums and redeveloped and revived riverfront, isn't nearly as pretty when seen from underneath some of its most vital transportation infrastructure.
TODD PORTUNE: We are standing underneath part of the support structure - substructure of a very important local bridge.
SCHAPER: This is Todd Portune, president of the Board of Hamilton County Commissioners. And we're actually standing near the juncture of three rusting, aging bridges spanning the Ohio River. One of them is the narrow, congested, I-75 Brent Spence Bridge.
PORTUNE: And it is very outdated. It is overburdened. It handles twice the amount of truck traffic it was ever designed to handle.
SCHAPER: That notorious bridge is rated as one of the worst in the country. It's so bottlenecked and accident-prone that many Cincinnati-area drivers go out of their way to avoid it. And don't even get Portune started on Cincinnati's other infrastructure needs, such as a $3.5 billion sewer system overhaul.
President Trump, speaking a few miles away, didn't disagree. In fact, he promised a new I-75 bridge when campaigning here. But Wednesday he chose a different backdrop, standing on the banks of the Ohio River with barges fully loaded with coal anchored behind him, to draw attention to another piece of the nation's aging infrastructure - inland waterways.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TRUMP: These critical corridors of commerce depend on a dilapidated system of locks and dams that is more than half a century old. And their condition - as you know better than anybody - is in very, very bad shape. It continues to decay.
SCHAPER: The president broadly outlined his solution - spending a trillion dollars rebuilding the nation's infrastructure.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TRUMP: At least $200 billion of the $1 trillion plan will come from direct federal investment. Working with states, local governments and private industry, we will ensure that these new federal funds are matched by significant additional dollars.
SCHAPER: It's not clear how cities, counties and states would come up with their share. And private investors would expect to be paid back with interest or profits from tolls or user fees. Tony Rosiello is a local township trustee who expected more.
TONY ROSIELLO: I think that the federal government - and even as a Republican saying this - they have an obligation when they built the expressway system back in the late '50s to keep things up - to keep things safe.
SCHAPER: Rosiello says he's willing to consider tolls or even the gas tax, though he knows many in his party won't, while Democrat Portune doesn't like much of Trump's plan at all.
PORTUNE: There's no specifics to this plan. Who knows how it's going to work - no details at all.
SCHAPER: Portune calls it just more of the same - big talk at the federal level followed by little funding, leaving local residents paying higher taxes, tolls or both. David Schaper, NPR News, Cincinnati.

The recommendation will be announced Friday, but many are expecting a twist that involves the 2028 games.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: 
There's a chance the Summer Olympics could come to United States for the first time this century. Los Angeles and Paris are competing for the 2024 Games. And on Friday, the International Olympic Committee's executive board is expected to make an unusual recommendation that could be a win for both cities. Ben Bergman of our member station KPCC has more.
BEN BERGMAN, BYLINE: 2024 became a two-city race after Rome, Hamburg and Budapest all dropped out of the running. Few governments want to risk the billions in cost overruns that have become synonymous with recent Olympics. That's why the IOC is considering awarding dual bids. Sports economist Ann Pegoraro says the IOC doesn't want to give up two strong bids now and risk having none for 2028.
ANN PEGORARO: I think, for them, they're looking at a bird in a hand. We have two cities that are super keen to host these games. And we need to make sure we lock them both up.
BERGMAN: Paris hasn't hosted the Olympics since 1924, making it a sentimental favorite. The city's leaders don't like the idea of waiting another four years, especially since they only have the financing to build their athlete's village for 2024. LA's bid uses existing facilities, making it far more flexible and cheaper. It won't need to build any new permanent venues. Plus LA Mayor Eric Garcetti says the IOC is willing to compensate LA for its patience.
ERIC GARCETTI: As we talked to the Olympics, they've asked us to think about both Paris and us. What would it take for us to consider one of us going first and the other going second?
BERGMAN: And Garcetti's answer?
GARCETTI: To bring youth sports for free to every zip code.
BERGMAN: Before any of this can happen, the full IOC membership has to approve tomorrow's executive board recommendation. To convince them, LA's bid has tried to evoke the nostalgia of its successful 1984 games, the last to turn a profit, while also trying to avoid the feeling of been there, done that. To that end, the CEO of LA's bid, Gene Sykes, says LA's slogan ""Follow The Sun"" is not about warm weather.
GENE SYKES: ""Follow The Sun"" is actually about looking at the future, focusing on what's next.
BERGMAN: LA's futuristic focus - reinvention, tech, youth - has served as a stark contrast to old-world Paris. Last month, members of the IOC toured potential venues in both cities. The chair of the evaluation commission, Patrick Baumann, said each bid was equally impressive.
PATRICK BAUMANN: It is clearly a win, win situation. And I think that we have two of the best possible cities that one can dream of being right now candidates for the Olympic Games.
BERGMAN: So how will they decide? Well, it's looking like they may not have to. For NPR News, I'm Ben Bergman in Los Angeles.

The Office of Government Ethics has posted ethics waivers granted by the Trump administration to federal agency officials. It frees them from full compliance with ethics rules. 
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: 
The Trump administration granted some waivers yesterday to nearly a dozen officials working across several federal agencies. The Office of Government Ethics had been demanding disclosure of the waivers from the White House. Here's NPR's Jackie Northam. 
JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: The waivers shed light on why and how some administration officials can continue to work on issues they covered before joining government. Many of those granted waivers are lobbyists and corporate executives. Take Lance Leggitt. He was the head of health policy at a law firm in Washington, D.C. and lobbied the Department of Health and Human Services. 
Now he's chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services. The Trump administration gave Leggitt a waiver because it said he brought, quote, ""a unique blend of substantive health care expertise."" Mr. Leggitt did not immediately respond to an email asking for comment. 
Robert Weissman, the president of the government watchdog group Public Citizen, says Leggitt's details stood out amongst the other waivers released. 
ROBERT WEISSMAN: Most of the waivers are not especially troublesome. They seem fairly perfunctory and don't really speak to their pervasive conflict of interest problems in the administration. It may be in part because the administration has been so slow to fill positions, and many of the people who are going to bring conflicts inside have not yet been confirmed. 
NORTHAM: Weissman says Wednesday's documents are in stark contrast to the ethics waivers of White House staff released a week ago. They showed presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway was allowed to communicate about broad policy matters with clients from her former consulting firm. And Chief Strategist Steve Bannon may meet privately with Breitbart News - the media company he formerly headed. Jackie Northam, NPR News, Washington.

But in an NPR survey, hundreds of drivers said they don't feel that way. They feel controlled by a boss that is both always there, and yet faceless.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: 
Uber, the ride-sharing service, has a slogan to recruit drivers. Company leaders say that at Uber you can be your own boss. You know, you're in the car. You drive when you want, knock off when you've had enough.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: 
Sounds great, right? But many drivers say it's not actually true. In dozens of interviews plus an informal survey, NPR News found hundreds of drivers who do not feel like their own boss. They feel controlled by a boss that is faceless but ever present.
INSKEEP: Today, NPR's Aarti Shahani begins a series of reports on Uber drivers and their employer.
AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: Imagine being able to drop your kids off at school every morning and then run errands because you're allowed to clock in when you want - 10 or 10:30 instead of 9 a.m. sharp. The power to set your own hours is rare. It's a power that Uber drivers have.
(SOUNDBITE OF AD)
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: And I drive with Uber because it gives me the time to spend with my son.
SHAHANI: This is a commercial from Uber.
(SOUNDBITE OF AD)
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And music's a big part of my life. And Uber allows me to keep it that way.
SHAHANI: The best slogans are enticing invitations - Nike's just do it, Apple's think different. Uber's be your own boss is special because it's not just great marketing, it's a legal argument. Uber claims drivers are independent contractors, not employees entitled to very expensive benefits. Uber commissioned a study that says 87 percent of drivers joined because they want to be their own boss, set their own schedule.
But company leaders have not publicly asked an obvious follow-up question. At Uber, do you feel like your own boss? So NPR asked. We conducted an informal survey reaching out to drivers through email lists and social media. A little more than half of respondents, 491 people, said they did, just like the people in the commercial. But perhaps less expected, nearly half - that is 436 - said they did not.
DAVID MCKEE: No, you don't feel like your own boss at all. The only thing you control is the time when you sign on and sign off. Other than that, Uber controls everything.
SHAHANI: Driver David McKee is from Vista, Calif. He and other respondents are self-selected and possibly more negative than the average driver. It's not a scientific poll. Still, it's a window into how many drivers feel about their workplace.
What hundreds say is Uber sets strict rules and punishments like a boss. Let's start with tracking, not on websites like Google does but tracking in the physical world. Driver McKee.
MCKEE: The state licenses you. And if you get tickets or accidents or something like that, then the state will take away your ability to drive. So I don't see where it's really up to Uber to be tracking how you drive. That's, you know, they're becoming the police.
SHAHANI: Uber uses the sensors in drivers' smartphones to monitor how they turn left or change lanes or stop. Turns out, 116 respondents say they didn't realize Uber was doing that. Uber does ask for consent in a long online contract. Four hundred and thirty-three would like Uber to stop the tracking. Competitor Lyft doesn't do it.
Uber says smartphone tracking is good for safety and helps drivers when passengers complain unfairly, so it's not a choice. UberPOOL is also not much of a choice. POOL is that option where passengers can share a car, but it turns out many drivers feel coerced by Uber into offering it. Driver Michael Makarov from Phoenix, Ariz.
MICHAEL MAKAROV: Well, when POOL started, I thought, oh, this is great. We're going to make more money.
SHAHANI: But that didn't happen. Drivers say POOL is just a way for passengers to pay way less while drivers make way less.
MAKAROV: So they're basically a giveaway for us.
SHAHANI: Uber says if you want to offer the standard service, UberX, you have to offer this cheaper one, too. The vast majority of respondents say they don't want to. When you're your own boss, you typically get to set the price, but at Uber, Uber sets the price. And it can change second by second according to a calculation that Uber keeps secret.
Drivers say this pricing scheme keeps them guessing. Take Dani Brockington, who's driving one night in Atlanta. Her Uber app says rates are way up because there's so much demand.
DANI BROCKINGTON: But I'm not getting any pings. And it's weird because I'm in really high-traffic districts.
SHAHANI: Because drivers don't really know what they'll make an hour, they could end up on the road far longer than expected or than the public would want. Seventy-nine drivers tell NPR they've worked shifts 14 hours or longer. Three even showed NPR proof of driving about 20 hours in one day.
Feeling controlled is one aspect of the Uber workplace and plenty of workers feel that. Another, which may be more unique, is not being able to reach a human in charge even in emergencies like when you've had an accident or gotten cut off the app.
JANELLE SALLENAVE: I would absolutely acknowledge to you that getting a Uber representative on the phone six months ago was a feat that frankly I don't know I would be able to do.
SHAHANI: Janelle Sallenave is in charge of driver and customer support at Uber.
SALLENAVE: We heard that feedback loud and clear from drivers.
SHAHANI: Sallenave says Uber has a lot of work to do to improve communication with drivers, and the company is doing that. They're staffing more than 200 physical drop-in centers and introducing new dedicated phone lines.
Drivers complaints about poor communication don't surprise her, but she maintains they are their own boss and have the choice to stay or go. Aarti Shahani, NPR News, San Francisco.

Angus King about his grilling of intelligence officials about why they wouldn't answer the Senate Intelligence Committee's questions.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: 
Fired FBI Director James Comey takes questions before a Senate panel today. His written testimony, already released, shows he kept a meticulous record of his meetings with President Trump. Yesterday, the same committee asked intelligence agency chiefs about their talks with the president. Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, insisted no one ever directed him to derail the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. But when questioned, he declined to say in public if he'd ever been asked to do that. Admiral Mike Rogers of the National Security Agency also turned aside some questions, which displeased Senator Angus King of Maine.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ANGUS KING: Why are you not answering these questions? Is there an invocation by the president of the United States of executive privilege? Is there or not?
MICHAEL ROGERS: Not that I'm aware of.
KING: Then why are you not answering the questions?
ROGERS: Because I feel it is inappropriate, Senator.
KING: What you feel isn't relevant, Admiral.
INSKEEP: Senator Angus King joins us now. He's an Independent, caucuses with the Democrats. Senator, welcome back to the program.
KING: Good morning, Steve. Glad to be here.
INSKEEP: So I'm just thinking they answered some of your questions. They didn't answer other questions. I'd say that I - for example, Coats saying, I wasn't directed, but not saying if he was asked. Even though you were frustrated, were they actually telling you something by what they didn't answer?
KING: Well, it was - it was really kind of puzzling because the questions were - were fairly straightforward. And as you heard on that little exchange, I said, you know, is there executive privilege? Is there - this classified - and there was really no answer to that. And, you know, my job, sitting in that chair, Steve, is to represent the people of Maine and ask the questions they would ask if they were sitting there. And our job is to get to the facts about this matter. And you can't get to the facts if the witnesses won't answer the questions.
INSKEEP: But I'm thinking if they're saying to you, no one ever directed me. But then they won't tell you if anyone ever asked them. I almost wonder if that's an official, in an impossible situation, who is basically telling you, well, actually someone did ask me. I just can't discuss that.
KING: Well, you know, that's what we want to get to the bottom of. And that was the sort of second line of my questioning is if they characterize the conversation as - as Director Cotes did - and said, no one directed me, the obvious follow up question is, well, did anyone ask you? What was the conversation? And he said, well, no I can't talk about that.
Well, wait a minute. If you can talk about it sort of, you can also answer the questions. And that's a perfect example where, you know, you want to follow up and say, what about this word directed now? What does that mean? Was it - were you asked? Was it suggested? What was the nature of the conversation? And that's where we got stonewalled, and that's when I started to lose my patience.
INSKEEP: So now you have another round with James Comey, the FBI director who was fired by President Trump. He's already released written testimony, as we mentioned. And one fact to that testimony - as James Comey affirms - that he did tell President Trump, on a number of occasions, that he was not personally a target of a counterintelligence investigation, which the White House is taking as - as vindication. But what specifically does that mean when you say that someone is not a target of a counterintelligence investigation?
KING: Well, all the - all the discussion has been contact between the Trump campaign and the Russians. And I can't recall any allegations along the way that President Trump directly made those contacts. We can't say one way or the other. But he was not a target of the counterterrorist investigation. That just means, in that situation, when Comey talked to him, that was - he wasn't looking at him personally. But I can tell you - I mean, James Comey has announced publicly that the FBI has been investigating the connections between the Trump campaign and the Russians for - I don't know - probably a year at this point.
INSKEEP: So you don't see this as vindication?
KING: Well, if it - he may say, well, this vindicates me personally, but that doesn't get to the question of his associates and his campaign. And he personally - you know, what about what's happened subject to those - subsequent to those conversations with - with Mr. Comey. So I don't - I can understand the White House saying, yeah, we weren't - he wasn't the subject of the investigation as of the date of those conversations. That - that's a fact. And we will probe the details of that today when we interview James Comey.
INSKEEP: OK, so you've already got his written testimony - James Comey's testimony. It's quite dramatic, almost novelistic in the details - describing phone calls and meetings and dinners with the president. And among other things, the president says to Comey, I need loyalty. I expect loyalty. I've been very loyal to you - very loyal - we had that thing, you know. He also asked for the investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn to be dropped at what - at some point. Was this appropriate behavior by the president the United States or not?
KING: Well, you're making me the judge and jury, as well as the - as the investigator, at this point. But clearly, I think Mr. Comey's written testimony, as you say, speaks for itself. And he - he himself felt very uneasy about this whole situation. There's not much question that he felt it was inappropriate because that's when he started keeping what amounted to a diary of these contacts. And he was - he didn't like being called to the White House for dinner by himself - talked about whether he wants to stay in his job, which was kind of weird because his job had a 10-year term, of which he had served, I think, two or three.
So the whole - that whole - the whole context of these conversations - I don't know if I'd use the word inappropriate. I'd use the word sort of strange and sort of - inappropriate may be the right - the right term that you - but again, Comey says in his testimony...
INSKEEP: About 10 seconds.
KING: ...What he was trying to do was educate the president and the White House about what the proper roles and boundaries should be.
INSKEEP: Senator, it's always a pleasure to talk with you. Thank you very much.
KING: Steve, always a pleasure. And we'll talk to you later.
INSKEEP: That's Senator Angus King of Maine.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: 
Yesterday's attacks on two different sites in Iran killed at least 13 people and prompted various responses. Reporter Ali Noorani of the AFP news agency says many Iranians are united in sympathy.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ALI NOORANI: There were lots of messages for Tehran with imagery and symbols of Tehran. People started designing graphics on social media - pray for Tehran or we stand together - the kinds of messages that we have always seen throughout all these attacks in various cities.
INSKEEP: Noorani says Iranians also asked who might have targeted their Parliament building complex as well as an important shrine. A video released by the attackers shows them speaking Arabic, which brings to mind for some Iranians the country's Arabic-speaking minorities. A different reaction came from the White House which said, we grieve and pray for the innocent victims, but added states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote.
Much to talk about here, and we've brought in Robin Wright of The New Yorker who's reported from Iran many times. Robin, welcome back to the program.
ROBIN WRIGHT: Great to be with you, Steve.
INSKEEP: Is there some truth to that White House response, edgy as it might have been, saying that Iran in effect fell victim to the same evil that it promotes?
WRIGHT: Well, Iran is on the top of the State Department's terrorism list and has been for many years. There's no question that the U.S. views Iran from that prism. At the same time, this also comes after two years of very intensive diplomacy between the U.S. secretary of state under the Obama administration and his Iranian counterpart that produced the historic nuclear deal.
And there were hopes that that would then generate a kind of raproshma (ph) gradual between the two countries that would help solve some of the regional conflicts, notably the war in Syria. But the response by the White House certainly does seem to undermine any diplomatic effort at the moment.
INSKEEP: And then there's the question of what effect there might be inside Iran, Robin Wright, because we do have this president, Hasan Rouhani, who just got re-elected who said, I want to encourage more freedom within the country.
But when you have an attack like this, it can also encourage your government to crackdown on dissent. What kind of effects might we see inside this country because of the attack?
WRIGHT: Well, the reaction in Tehran is going to be no different than it would be in London, Manchester, Paris, Berlin or elsewhere. There will be a sweeping look at who might be responsible, what cells have been operating under - off the radar. So no question that there will be a crackdown.
And, of course, Iran as a pervasive intelligence community and a core of volunteers who kind of spy on Iranians to find out what social or criminal activity they may be involved in that violates Islamic tenets. So they have a much greater apparatus.
And there is this moment in the revolution that there is particular tension between those like the re-elected president who want to open up society a little bit more, want to deal with the West and want to better the economy - the kind of reforms. But he faces very severe challenges from the deep state, the military, the intelligence community, some of the hard-liners who don't want to see the revolutionary tenets compromised in any way. So there's a lot at stake.
INSKEEP: And when we talk about - yeah, and when we talk the revolution, of course, we're talking about the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the government talks as though that's still ongoing. What does it mean, Robin, that ISIS would target Iran at this moment? What does that tell us about Iran and about the region?
WRIGHT: This is unprecedented. And the interesting thing about it is that these two - the Islamic State and the Islamic Republic offer two very different visions of the ideal Islamic government. Iran is a modern republic with a constitution based on French-Belgian law that has Islamic tenants added onto it in parallel institutions where it wants to be part of the 21st century in its own cultural way, whereas the Islamic State wants to take society back to the 7th century.
But what's - in terms of security, this is a first. The Islamic State has not put Iran in its crosshairs. Iran is the predominant Shiite country. The Islamic State is Sunni. And so this is sectarian in nature as well as two rivals. And this ups the ante at a time that the Islamic State is losing territory, and it's clearly trying to say it's still around. It's still a force to be reckoned with.
INSKEEP: Robin, always a pleasure talking with you. Thanks very much.
WRIGHT: Thanks, Steve.
INSKEEP: Robin Wright is, among other things, a contributing writer for The New Yorker and has been for many years a frequent visitor to Iran.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: 
There's a man in Russia who's doing something no Russian politician has done in a long time. Alexei Navalny is running a national political campaign based on grassroots enthusiasm rather than backroom Kremlin deals. As he prepares his bid in next year's presidential election, Navalny is traveling all over Russia. NPR's Lucian Kim caught up with him on the campaign trail.
ALEXEI NAVALNY: (Speaking Russian).
LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: ""Hi, hi, hello,"" says Alexei Navalny as he shakes hands with every volunteer who walks into his new campaign office in Tula, the center of Russia's gun industry, 100 miles south of Moscow.
(APPLAUSE)
KIM: The volunteers, mostly 20-something and male, can barely contain their admiration for Navalny, who started as an anti-corruption blogger and now is using the internet to launch his presidential campaign. He wants to challenge President Vladimir Putin, who is expected to run for a fourth term.
NAVALNY: (Speaking Russian).
KIM: ""It can't be that a country that's swimming in petrodollars holds its population in poverty,"" Navalny says. ""It means they've made off with the money.""
Gaping income disparity, greedy officials and potholed roads are all things that make ordinary Russians angry, and Navalny hammers away at them. He then takes questions on everything from the army draft - he'd abolish it - to LGBT rights. He says people's private lives are nobody else's business.
Alexei Makarkin, a Moscow political analyst, says the last politician who ran the same kind of grassroots campaign and evoked the same enthusiasm was Boris Yeltsin, Russia's first president 25 years ago.
ALEXEI MAKARKIN: (Speaking Russian).
KIM: Makarkin says the chances of the Kremlin letting Navalny run as a presidential candidate are close to zero, but that the opposition leader's real goal is to build a broad base of support he can use as a political tool later if social discontent grows.
ANTON KONDAKOV: (Speaking Russian).
KIM: Anton Kondakov, a 27-year-old Navalny volunteer in Tula, says five years ago, nobody talked about politics, but now Russia's sluggish economy is forcing even Putin supporters to change their minds. He says people are spending 70 percent of their income on food.
NAVALNY: (Speaking Russian).
KIM: A few hours later, Navalny is addressing another crowd, this time in Kaluga, a town with a big Volkswagen plant 60 miles west of Tula.
NAVALNY: (Speaking Russian).
KIM: His message is the same; we can change Russia, but you need to go out and protest against corruption on June 12. That's when Navalny wants to show the Kremlin how much clout he wields in Russia's provinces.
The crowd here is smaller but just as enthusiastic.
NAVALNY: (Speaking Russian).
KIM: There's a girl who's wearing a homemade T-shirt with Navalny's face on it above the English word hope. There's a high school student whose parents are convinced Navalny is an American agent, and there's 22-year-old college student Yevgeny Zhazhin.
YEVGENY ZHAZHIN: No matter how dark things seem in our country, they are changeable. And I can do something to change the way things are going now.
KIM: Still, he admits there's an element of fear.
ZHAZIN: And of course, I'm afraid a little because it's hard to be all brave in our country because things can happen.
KIM: Zhazhin says he hasn't even told his parents that he's now running Nalvalny's Kaluga office. Lucian Kim, NPR News, Kaluga, Russia.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: 
Back in Washington, President Trump faces a different challenge today. Much of the nation will be watching what's expected to be historic testimony from former FBI Director James Comey on Capitol Hill. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly will be watching, too, but from a rather different vantage point. She is in Moscow, tracking the Russia controversy from there all week, and she's on the line now. Hey, Mary Louise.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.
MARTIN: Are people paying attention to James Comey over there?
KELLY: Not so much. I mean, put it this way, most Russians have not heard of Jim Comey. I was just out strolling on the street right outside my hotel. It's called Tverskaya. It's one of the main arteries in central Moscow. And it's a typical Thursday commute, and the legendarily awful traffic in Moscow is as awful as ever. So safe to say people are more worried about trying to get where they're going today than watching Jim Comey...
MARTIN: That's rational.
KELLY: ...But, you know, Russians are watching big picture - these big Russia investigations unfolding in Washington, and they are - they are bewildered by it.
MARTIN: So when you talk with Russians and the conversation moves to Russia's interference in the U.S. election, what do they say?
KELLY: I have had many people this week ask me, where's the proof? It's, you Americans say Russia meddled, well, prove it. And I'm hearing this from across the political spectrum, people who say they love Putin, people who say they can't stand Putin. I had lunch yesterday with a Russian army general who seemed amazed at this obsession, as he put it, with Russia that he said has gripped Washington. Let me actually play you a little bit of that. This is retired Lieutenant General Evgeny Buzhinsky.
EVGENY BUZHINSKY: No offense meant, but U.S. politicians are crazy. Russia is to blame for everything - for everything in the world - Russian hackers, Russian spies, the ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, I know him very well, good friend of mine. It's his job to meet with people, to meet with high-level politicians, high-level government officials and to talk. What's wrong with that?
KELLY: So General Buzhinsky talking there about the Russian ambassador to Washington, Sergey Kislyak, and of course, the meetings we've since learned about between Kislyak and Trump aides.
MARTIN: OK, so when he says U.S. politicians are crazy, are they denying - are they denying that Russia played any role in the 2016 election?
KELLY: Yes, many Russians do. And you can push back on it, as of course I do, and point out, look, all 17 U.S. spy agencies say this happened. They say it with high confidence that Russia meddled. Did they all get it wrong? You can point out it's not just U.S. intelligence. Brits - British intelligence, the French, the Germans, they all say they're watching Russian attempts to interfere. But what you will hear back, as you've heard there from General Buzhinsky, as I've heard from professors and taxi drivers and others is where's the proof? What's the evidence?
MARTIN: Yeah, OK. So this is just a taste of the reporting you're doing in Russia because we're going to hear a lot more of it tomorrow. You are there with our colleague David Greene. He's going to host the show from Moscow. That's going to be cool...
KELLY: It is so exciting. Yeah, we're going to be out of NPR Moscow bureau, which is a first. There's a whole team of us in here, and we are carbo-loading in preparation.
MARTIN: I'm sure. Knowing David Greene, he's taking you to some good restaurants and bars.
KELLY: We have eaten our body weight in Georgian dumplings. Put it that way.
MARTIN: National security correspondent Mary Louise Kelly reporting this week from Moscow. Thanks so much, Mary Louise.
KELLY: You're so welcome.

Kenya is the latest African country to combat the environmental problems caused by plastic bags. They litter the landscape, but many Kenyans find them indispensable for daily life. 
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: 
Here's a story of interest to anybody who ever wondered about the environmental damage caused by plastic bags. Kenya is joining its east African neighbors by announcing that starting this fall plastic bags will be illegal, which the government argues is the right thing to do. But does it match up with reality? NPR's Eyder Peralta went to a neighborhood in Nairobi where plastic bags are essential to daily life. 
EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Kibera is one of the largest slums in Africa. It's a colossal collection of shabby structures. And one of the defining characteristics is plastic. It's on roofs and on walls and clogging drainages. And, of course, there are bags - hills of them. They're used to sort corn or carry produce. Julius Moleil hands his customers 50 cents worth of coal in old plastic bags. 
JULIUS MOLEIL: (Foreign language spoken). 
PERALTA: He says every single person in Kibera uses plastic bags. And none of his customers are going to carry coal in their hands or even in a reusable sack. 
KENNETH OKOTH: It may look very fashionable in international circles. Kenya has taken a drastic step. But in reality, in a place like Kibera, we still need those plastics. 
PERALTA: That's Kenneth Okoth, the member of parliament representing the Kibera slum. He says this is an elitist policy put together by a minister without thought. Here in Kibera, for example, where there is little running water - no toilets or outhouses - the ban would affect even biodegradable bags residents used to defecate and urinate in. The so-called pee-poo bags are handed out by NGOs. 
Okoth says he understands and supports the need to clean up the environment. But there are better ways to do that, he says, than a blanket ban on plastics. 
OKOTH: It's not the plastic's fault. It's a lack of a system to collect the plastic and reuse it and make a value chain out of it beyond that first usage. 
PERALTA: Back on the streets, I find Eunice Masila. She's a shopkeeper cleaning onions. And she's worried about that plastic bag ban. While women do the bulk of the shopping, she's worried about the money she makes off men. She says men will refuse to carry produce out in the open. And they certainly won't carry it in reusable market bags. 
EUNICE MASILA: He don't want to - everyone to know he's carrying onion or he's carrying tomatoes because, in Africa, we believe ladies, they are the one to buy these goods. 
PERALTA: Not only that, she says, but right now men also buy opaque bags from her to hide their purchases. That's a little extra business. And something she suspects that lawmakers don't understand.

The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, is in Jerusalem. There she met Israeli leaders who are angry with the way the U.N. treats Israel, and Haley agrees. NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from Jerusalem.
DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Israel is the only country whose human rights record is a permanent item on the U.N. Human Rights Council's agenda. Israel's treatment of Palestinians is a major focus. And out of all the council's resolutions concerning specific countries, Israel ranks at the top. Syria comes in second place. Yesterday, Ambassador Nikki Haley sat across from Israel's president and called the United Nations a bully.

NIKKI HALEY: I have never taken kindly to bullies. And the U.N. has blamed Israel for a very long time. And we're not going to let that happen anymore.
ESTRIN: Haley arrived in Jerusalem the day after she visited the Human Rights Council in Geneva. She told the council it must address what she called its chronic anti-Israel bias. In a separate speech in Geneva, Haley hinted the U.S. could quit the council.
In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Haley she and President Trump are drawing new standards for dealing with the U.N. It makes a world of difference, Netanyahu said. Haley also met with Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah in the West Bank and discussed the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Jerusalem.

Comey may answer some of those questions in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee during his testimony tomorrow. But on the eve of that high-profile appearance, what do Americans think about the controversy?
A CBS News poll in March found that 50 percent of Americans believe Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Forty percent said Russia interfered to help Mr. Trump, while 10 percent said the Russians interfered, but not necessarily to help Mr. Trump. Thirty-seven percent say there was no interference. There was a deep partisan split: only 26 percent of Republicans said Russia interfered in the election, compared to 74 percent of Democrats.
A CBS News/YouGov Nation Tracker poll released in May found that 44 percent of respondents describe the Russia investigation as ""critical to national security,"" while 32 percent of respondents believe the investigation is a ""witch hunt."" Twenty-three percent said it's ""serious, but shouldn't get in the way of other things."" Again, the partisan divide was evident – a huge majority of Republicans polled called the investigation a witch hunt, while an even bigger majority of Democrats said it's a critical national security issue.
On the subject of Comey's firing, most Americans believe the move was poorly timed. Sixty percent of respondents in the Nation Tracker poll, mostly Democrats, said the president should not have fired Comey when he did, while 40 percent, mostly Republicans, disagreed. 
Comey reportedly authored several memos during his time serving under Mr. Trump alleging that the president tried to get him to halt his investigation. Forty-eight percent of Nation Tracker respondents said they believe Mr. Trump was aiming to stop the investigation when he talked with Comey, while 37 percent said the two men ""just talked about it."" Fifteen percent said Mr. Trump and Comey didn't discuss the investigation at all. Republicans were far more likely than Democrats to say the subject didn't come up. 
Trump, in response to Comey's reported memos, suggested he had tapes of his conversations with Comey. According to the Nation Tracker poll, approximately three quarters of Americans would like both the tapes and the memos to be turned over to Congress (slightly more would like to see the tapes.)
And broadly speaking, by a nearly two-to-one margin, Americans disapprove of the way Mr. Trump has handled the controversy. Sixty-three percent of Americans, including 21 percent of Republicans and 91 percent of Democrats, registered their disapproval in the Nation Tracker poll. Only 37 percent -- 79 percent of Republicans and 9 percent of Democrats -- said they approve of the president's handling of matters related to the investigation.
All of this comes while President Trump's approval rating continues to hover at or below 40 percent. According to a new Economist/YouGov poll, the President's approval rating is 40 percent, with 56  disapproval. And a Gallup poll released Wednesday puts the president's approval at 38 percent, and his disapproval at 57 percent.   
The CBS News Poll took place between March 25 and March 28, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent. The CBS News Nation Tracker took place between May 15 and May 19 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percent. The Gallup poll surveyed 1,500 adults between June 4 and June 6, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus three percent. The Economist/YouGov survey polled 1,500 adults between June 4 and June 6, and it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percent.","What Americans think of Comey, Trump, Russia",normal,a64c38307db8768d6498612ad7c41bfeb228a57d

Griff Witte, London bureau ... 
But for May the time seemed right. She became prime minister through a Conservative Party leadership contest when predecessor David Cameron resigned after the referendum, and an early election would give her the chance to gain a personal mandate from voters. 
With polls suggesting a big Conservative lead, May looked likely to increase her majority in Parliament and strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with the EU . Who are the contenders? 
In the blue corner -- traditional color of the Conservative Party -- is May, a 60-year-old lawmaker known in her party as a quietly effective operator. A former advocate of remaining in the EU, she now promises to press forward with Brexit, taking Britain out of the bloc, reducing immigration and forging a new relationship with the U.K.'s European neighbors. 
In the opposition red corner is the Labour Party's Jeremy Corbyn, a 68-year-old socialist who was elected leader by party members two years ago -- to the chagrin of many Labour lawmakers, who wanted a more centrist chief. 
Jeremy Corbyn, Leader of the Labour Party, waves to supporters after speaking at a campaign rally at Union Chapel in Islington, June 7, 2017, in London. Getty 
Critics say Corbyn, an advocate of nationalization and other old-left policies, embodies an outdated vision the party left behind during the ""New Labour"" years of Prime Minister Tony Blair. Supporters see him as a refreshingly authentic alternative to the pro-business, budget-cutting Conservatives. 
Among smaller parties, the pro-independence Scottish National Party is seeking to repeat its 2015 near-sweep of seats in Scotland. The staunchly pro-EU Liberal Democrats hope to scoop up voters opposed to leaving the bloc. And the U.K. Independence Party -- instrumental in getting Britain to leave the EU -- hopes to regain a foothold in Parliament, after losing its sole lawmaker before the election. What are the big issues? 
Brexit, which had been expected to dominate the campaign, has played a surprisingly small role. Both Labour and the Conservatives say they will go through with the split, then seek the closest possible relationship with the EU. Neither party has provided many details of how this will be accomplished. 
The election's early stages pointed toward the predicted coronation for May and the Conservatives, campaigning under the slogan ""strong and stable government."" 
But it soon became clear that Corbyn's anti-austerity message was resonating with many voters, especially the young . Labour has successfully painted the election as a choice between two visions of society, promising to govern ""for the many, not the few."" 
May's tightly controlled campaign style, which saw her speaking largely to hand-picked groups of supporters, began to grate. And then the party produced an election manifesto that gave ammunition to critics; a proposal to make pensioners pay for more of their long-term care costs was a plan dubbed a ""dementia tax"" by opponents. 
May then made the disastrous move of backing down on the policy, seriously undermining her ""strong and stable"" mantra. What role has terrorism played? 
Two deadly attacks transformed the campaign, pushing terrorism and security to the top of the agenda. ",Britain votes in a surprise election full of surprises,normal,b8b984a251a77f4f6e23c45225d679129c04ac71

With medical costs continuing to rise along with the uncertainty about the future of health insurance coverage, new research shows more Americans are going without the health care they need. 
A survey released Wednesday from Bankrate.com found that one in four American families have not sought medical care because they couldn't afford it. Thirteen percent of respondents had no insurance, while the rest had a mix of employer-sponsored, individual and Medicaid coverage. The bulk of uninsured respondents were millennials. Younger, healthier people traditionally go without coverage. 
However, ""Even insured people found co-pays and deductibles far less affordable than they expected,"" said Robin Saks Frankel, credit card analyst at Bankrate.com 
Two years ago, a Kaiser Family Foundation study found that only three in five households have enough set aside to meet an individual deductible of $1,200 or a family deductible of $2,400. Only about half of U.S. households had enough money to cover higher deductibles than those. President Obama's former economic adviser Austan Goolsbee joins CBSN to discuss the costs of the American Health Care Act, the GOP's replacement ... 
Health care advocates and economists agree that forgoing health care can have devastating long-term consequences. It can mean patients get sicker and require even more expensive treatment when they end up in the emergency room. These types of unexpected medical bills can lead to a huge financial burden for the patient that could take years to pay off, said Frankel. 
If you're struggling with medical costs or skipping the care you need, here are four strategies that may help make your health care more affordable. 
Schedule your annual physical. If you have insurance, there's no reason to skip this important appointment. Under the Affordable Care Act, annual physicals are 100 percent covered. That means no co-pay, and your deductible doesn't have to be met beforehand. Spotting medical problems while they're small can prevent big problems (and bigger medical bills) down the road. If your physical yields some unwelcome results, you can talk to your doctor about the cost of future diagnostics and care. See the next item. 
Don't be afraid to negotiate . If you're due for an expensive test, procedure or a series of doctor visits, be sure to ask about the price and your out-of-pocket costs ahead of time. You can research the costs at various labs and facilities in your area at websites such as Healthcare Bluebook .

A new kind of brain scan may be able to predict when a baby as young as 6 months old will develop autism, researchers said Wednesday. 
The approach is not likely to be useful for all kids, but in children considered at high risk because an older sibling has autism, the scans correctly chose nine out of 11 children who later were diagnosed with autism out of a group of 59 high-risk kids.

“If future studies confirm these results, detecting brain differences may enable physicians to diagnose and treat autism earlier than they do today,” said Dr. Diana Bianchi, director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which helped fund the study. 
The team has been trying several different types of scans to find early evidence of autism, a developmental disorder that starts before birth and that’s marked by changes in how the brain works. “You have the opportunity to find out if something is off.” 
The same team, with members at the University of North Carolina and Washington University in St. Louis, has used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to find structural changes in the brains of babies born with autism, and used another type of MRI, called functional connectivity MRI, to see if they might find differences in the way brain regions communicate in infancy. 
They did. Reporting in the journal Science Translational Medicine, the researchers said they found various differences that allowed them to correctly predict nine of the 11 6-month-old infants who were later diagnosed with autism. 
Christa Robaina, a mom from Charlotte whose 6-year-old son has autism, said an early heads up can make all the difference for worried parents. 
""This been a blessing for us and just calming our fears,"" said Robaina, whose infant daughter took part in some of the team’s research.

“We know what it’s like as a family to be in the abyss of not knowing who your enemy is and what you are fighting.” 
Robaina said her family spent thousands of dollars in co-pays to have MRIs and genetic tests for their son. He was not medically diagnosed with autism until he was 5, but she had her suspicions much earlier. 
He was born prematurely and was ""a little bit behind"" on meeting developmental milestones, she said. ""We were told this was typical of preemies,"" Robaina told NBC News. ""At 12 months, I had that mother’s instinct to know something was not right."" 
But as a first-time mom, she did not completely trust those instincts. 
Later on, she became more worried. ""He didn’t respond to his name,"" she said. Hearing tests showed that wasn’t the problem. ""He would sit and play in a room all by himself unattended and would have no problem with that."" 
Difficulty in interacting socially with people is one of the characteristic symptoms of autism, a so-called ""spectrum disorder"" because people with the condition show a range of symptoms, from mild social awkwardness to profoundly disabling behaviors. 
Robaina was worried about her daughters, now aged 2 and 4, so she enrolled the youngest in the study at the University of North Carolina. 
“You have the opportunity to find out if something is off,” she said. So far, the two girls have not been diagnosed with autism.

Psychiatrist Dr. Joseph Piven, of UNC-Chapel Hill, said it’s particularly hard to diagnose autism in infants. 
“They don’t look like they have autism in the first year,” he said. “Social deficits emerge over the first two years of life, and [we] have not been able to move the needle down on early detection.” 
So his team’s been trying to find other ways to spot autism early. They’ve been putting sleeping babies into MRI scanners to see what’s different about their brains. They tested younger sibling of kids already diagnosed with autism, because those sibling are known to be at higher risk. 
""Infants with high familial risk for autism spectrum disorder begin life with about a 20 percent chance of developing autism spectrum disorder compared to about 1.5 percent in infants with low or unknown risk,” they wrote in their report. 
Autism is diagnosed in about 1 in 68 U.S. kids, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There is no single known cause, although it’s clear autism starts well before birth and has strong genetic components. 
Because it is a developmental disorder, the symptoms may make it seem as if a child is regressing, making parents mistakenly think it’s something that happens to children as toddlers that causes autism. Brain studies like Piven’s can be reassuring to parents. 
“The defining behavioral characteristics of autism generally unfold during the second year of life, typically showing consolidation of the full behavioral syndrome by about 24 months of age or later,” Piven and colleagues wrote. “We have some idea that the brain is more malleable in infants.” 
“Behavioral differences in autism spectrum disorder have been observed as early as 6 months of age in characteristics such as gross motor ability, visual reception, and patterns of eye tracking; however, these associated characteristics have not been able to predict which children will later receive a diagnosis.” 
Brain imaging may be the best way to give parents an early warning. Some studies suggest that working with parents of infants may help them alter the course of their development. 
“You can maybe intervene and change the patterns,” said UNC researcher Robert Emerson. “We have some idea that the brain is more malleable in infants.” 
Emerson and Piven noted, however, that it’s not clear whether early interventions can prevent autism — but no one will be able to study that unless and until there is a reliable way to detect the infants who are most at risk. 
“I think as a mom you probably always have mommy guilt,"" said Robaina. ""I look back at things I did in my pregnancy and things that I ate.""

But an early warning could help parents prepare. 
""You have the opportunity to go find out if something is off,"" she said. ""A lot of moms think it’s just fine. Everyone tells you they’ll walk, they’ll talk and then they don’t — and you’ve passed a window where you can have done something."" 
Robaina said she's been trying dietary changes, physical and occupational therapy and other therapeutic approaches with success in her children. 
Emerson said it’s hard to explain the differences in the brains of the babies with autism — it took a complicated computer algorithm to make the predictions. Some areas of connection from one part of the brain were more active in the babies with autism, and some were less active. 
""No one has done this kind of study in 6-month-olds before, and so it needs to be replicated. We hope to conduct a larger study soon with different study participants,"" Emerson added. 
And it will never be something for every kid to try — MRIs can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. 
""It is not really an efficient strategy to have every kid scanned at 6 months of age to see if they have autism,"" Piven said. Maggie Fox",Brain Scans May Help Predict Autism in High-Risk Infants - NBC News,normal,e80f03671e9ddc2e44543be0fcb3c615e552c7fd

Problem # 2 with the questions that beg for answers, and our swamp boys are oblivious to the long term damage. It's not just the witch hunt. That's the wasteful time and money part. It's the immorality, unethicalness, and the implications. It really is n affliction of how much people lie so they don't have to take responsibility for their lack of will. 

Just as an example. The voting that takes place to get something passed, or someone elected. As distasteful as our Tramp turned out to be, he said things from his own experience. I'm sure he ""donated"" to hundreds of the people in Congress. Look up the Pam Bondi name, and his 25 thousand dollars. She was bribed, yet got promoted by him. He still had tp pay back for his University scam. Then, the witches are out in full force right now. Voting districts all over this country are starting to blame the Russians for their ""machines"" being hacked. Utter nonsense. Get your ""machines"" in order, and stop screwing with the mail in ballots. Stop denying legal citizens from voting, and have your districts report to the media when you disqualify votes. Our voting is a sham, just as the Tramp said.

Forget Russia and fix ourselves. We know Hillary destroyed Federal evidence implicating herself. Lynch and Comey should have her in prison. Hillary DID wipe her servers clean, after we found them, years later. She extorted money for her and Bubba's ""charity"". Two for it, and one, two for them. Then comes the prize.
Did Obama or Ben Rhodes, or (very doubtful, but in play) Valerie Jarret tell SAMANTHA POWER and SUSAN RICE to unmask names? That's how Flynn's conundrum became public. His name was leaked, and tied to the Tramp. Maybe it's true. Maybe Comey had got a message to Obama that Tramp is running a boiler room in his Tower, tied to Russia. Obama is know for his long term thinking and conniving. 
WHO WAS THE UN AMBASSADOR UNMASKING NAMES FOR? The subpoena was suppose to be answered yesterday by the FBI. Congress (Nunes) filed it 8 days ago. You know it is the key to the leaker and real law breakers. Pelosi and Schumer went into hyperdrive insanity. 
Did the chicken (the unmasking of Flynn), or the egg (Russia with a pinch of Vault 7) come first? 
This is what makes Clockwork Orange so despicable. He knows Obama and friends spied on him, then leaked it to WAPO and the NY TIMES. But, an honest man would have cleaned up the mess, then fixed our country. Instead this crook is using this to help himself to the wealth of what's left of our treasury. Then, destroying any fabric that our forefathers used to write our laws on.

Paperback, 528   Alice Network Author Kate Quinn   ""Solve for X."" That's the phrase invoked repeatedly by Charlotte ""Charlie"" St. Clair, the brainy college student at the center of Kate Quinn's exciting new novel, The Alice Network . In the aftermath of World War II, Charlie is thrown together with a veteran female spy from the previous war in a high-stakes journey to locate disappeared figures from the past. Unsolved puzzles and cryptic riddles crop up like weeds in a bomb crater, and as math-whiz Charlie puts it, ""There was always an answer and the answer was either right or it was wrong."" But her adventures turn out to be messy, non-formulaic and not so black and white, which after all is what makes life — and novels — interesting.
The year is 1947. Charlie's posh Bennington College existence gets derailed by an unwanted pregnancy. Her domineering French mother hauls her off to Europe, heading for a clinic that will take care of her ""Little Problem,"" as she calls her condition throughout the novel. En route, Charlie hatches an alternative plan — to track down her beloved cousin Rose, lost somewhere in France. In Europe, the ""hangover of war was still visible in a way you didn't see in New York."" Rose is a refugee amid a horde of displaced persons, a single grain of sand on a blasted, nearly obliterated beach, but Charlie is determined to ""solve for X"" and find her.
Enter Eve Gardiner, a raging, hard-drinking, foul-mouthed WWI espionage agent who just might possess a clue to Rose's whereabouts. When Charlie first comes into her room, Eve cocks a Luger pistol and demands, ""Who are you, and what the bloody f—- are you doing in my house?"" In alternating chapters with alternating world wars as backdrops, we follow Eve's exploits in 1915 in ""the Alice Network,"" a historically accurate cabal of spies.
Shedding the overbearing chaperone of a mother, Charlie and Eve set off to find Rose in a real beaut of a car, a dark-blue convertible Aston Martin Lagonda. Cherchez l'homme : Serving as their driver is a charming but war-stunned Scotsman, Finn, master of the ""one-pan breakfast."" In romances and historical novels alike, the word ""tousled"" is a tell-tale signifier, and it certainly works that way here: ""Finn's tousled dark head leaned out the window, and I saw the ember glow of his cigarette,"" Charlie says at one point. Equipped with Eve's ever-ready Luger, the intrepid trio travel through Lille, Limoge and Grasse, vielle French towns that Quinn renders in exquisite detail. Charlie sponsors the journey by pawning a precious rope of pearls inherited from her grandmere .
In 'The Alice Network,' the lives of two indomitable women intertwine in a plot crackling with suspense.
Both women experience transformations, Charlie by dumping her New Look full skirts and petticoats for slim black slacks and a Euro-chic striped sweater, Eve by learning to treat her traveling companions with a modicum of respect. Charlie's arrogance doesn't change — ""there wasn't a bill anywhere I couldn't tot up faster than an adding machine"" — but she lets her guard down enough to find kinship with both Finn and Eve.
And at the heart of Quinn's telling is the true story of the covert Alice Network , through which courageous men and women infiltrated the German lines in rural France. Lili, in the novel the chief handler of the group, is based on a real woman who at the time was called a ""regular Joan of Arc."" With dozens of operatives under her command, Lili asserts that the Germans will never be able to find her: ""I'm a handful of water, running everywhere.""
Despite this brand of courageous self-assurance, displayed by all the women in the story, Quinn's novel gives us tragedies, too, both from war and from pursuing the ghosts and demons of the past. But these pains are offset by the invigorating pleasure of the read. In The Alice Network , the lives of two indomitable women intertwine in a plot crackling with suspense. We root for Charlie and Eve, and cheer when they triumph.

Former FBI Director James Comey will testify before Congress for the first time Thursday morning since President Trump fired him nearly a month ago. 
James Comey testimonty today 9 a.m. ET, CBSN Online coverage begins 10 a.m. ET, James Comey testimony expected to begin 1 p.m. ET, Private Senate Intelligence Committee session expected to begin Comey is expected to say, according to his opening statement released Wednesday, that President Trump asked him to ""lift the cloud"" over him and the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.
The former FBI director will also confirm earlier reports that  Mr. Trump asked that Comey drop the FBI's investigation into former National Security Adviser Gen. Michael Flynn , a day after his resignation, and Comey will also confirm that  the president requested a pledge of loyalty .
The top Democrat has also released excerpts of his opening statement. He called Comey's opening statement ""disturbing."" And citing reports that DNI Dan Coats and NSA Director Mike Rogers were pressed by the president to publicly downplay the Russia investigation, Warner says, ""This is not how a President of the United States behaves.

Warner releases excerpts of his opening statement.  The top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, in his opening statement will address former FBI Director James Comey and note that while they haven't always agreed, ""I've never had any reason to question your integrity, expertise or intelligence.""
He'll note, according to excerpts released before the hearing, that Comey has been ""a straight shooter with this Committee and have been willing to speak truth to power, even at the risk of your career."" And that, Warner says, ""makes the way in which you were fired by the President utterly shocking.""
Warner addresses Comey's testimony, released Wednesday, and calls it ""disturbing,"" citing the dinner in January when ""the President appears to have threatened Director Comey's job, while telling him 'I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.'""
He'll also point to Mr. Trump's request that Comey drop the investigation into Michael Flynn, as well as the president's two calls to Comey on Mar. 30 and Apr. 11 asking him to, as Comey put it, ""lift the cloud"" of the Russia investigation. These calls, Warner says, are in ""violation of clear guidelines put in place after Watergate to prevent any whiff of political interference by the White House into FBI investigations.""
And citing reports that DNI Dan Coats and NSA Director Mike Rogers were pressed by the president to publicly downplay the Russia investigation, Warner says, ""This is not how a President of the United States behaves. Regardless of the outcome of our investigation into those Russia links, Director Comey's firing and his testimony raise separate and troubling questions that we must get to the bottom of.""
At the same time the President was engaged in these efforts with Director Comey, he was also allegedly pressuring senior leaders of the intelligence community to downplay the Russia investigation or intervene with Director Comey. DNI Coats and NSA Director Admiral Rogers had plenty of opportunities to deny those reports yesterday. They did not. This is not how a President of the United States behaves.

TUNKHANNOCK, EATON TOWNSHIP, Pa. -- State Police say four people are dead in a murder-suicide in a northeast Pennsylvania supermarket.
Troopers responded to a report of someone shooting people inside Weis Market in Eaton Township, about 25 miles northwest of Scranton, just before 1 a.m. Thursday.
The store was closed at the time, but workers stock shelves overnight, reports CBS affiliate WYOU-TV.
Troopers found the bodies of two males and two females inside. A witness was able to escape unharmed and call 911.
WKOK-AM reported that the gunman fired randomly in the store in addition to targeting the victims. Authorities believe the gunman opened fire on the others before turning the gun on himself.
Police have since identified the shooter as 24-year-old Randy Stair of Dallas, and the victims as 26-year-old Victoria Brong of Factoryville, 47-year-old Brian Hayes of Springville, and 63-year-old Terry Sterling of South Montrose.
Police didn't say whether the gunman was an employee or how he otherwise knew the victims.
""We believe this is a contained incident and the public is not in any danger at this time,"" police said in the release.

Steve King of Iowa has been supportive of President Trump. He talks to Steve Inskeep about former FBI Director James Comey appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: 
The perspectives we're hearing this morning on Comey's testimony includes Senator Angus King of Maine, who's an independent caucusing with the Democrats.
ANGUS KING: The whole context of these conversations, I don't know if I'd use the word inappropriate. I'd use the word sort of strange, and sort of inappropriate may be the right the right term.
INSKEEP: That's Angus King. And now we have another King, Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, who's been supportive of President Trump. Congressman, welcome to the program.
STEVE KING: Oh, thanks very much. I'm happy to be on this morning.
INSKEEP: Does the written testimony that you've already seen show a president acting the way that a president should?
S. KING: You know, I think if I hadn't heard all of the news and all the hype building up to this, if I more or less came out of a vacuum and sat down in my office and read this transcript or this testimony that Comey will deliver today, I don't think I would have been alarmed at all. I think the hype to it causes us to look at some of these things in a little bit different light.
But when I see, you know, the language in there when the president said to Comey, I need loyalty, I'm not alarmed by that. The president does need loyalty. He has people that are turning on him, and they're leaking from inside the White House. They were leaking from the intelligence community. And it's undermining our national security. And it's stalling the agenda that the American people voted for, so...
INSKEEP: I understand your concern about leaking, but should a president be asking an FBI director who's supposed to be independently investigating people close to the president, should he be repeatedly asking that person for loyalty and to drop investigations?
S. KING: Well, you put that kind of into a package there, but was that the flow of the conversation? And I think probably not. I think it's fine for the president to have a conversation with, for example, with James Comey. And when he said, I hope you can let this go, that's far from a directive. And if Comey is intimidated by that or if he thought that that was an order, he should have asked, Mr. President, is that an order? That'd be a different story, but it was just a suggestion. And I think that's just a management style.
And, by the way, the, you know, the one-on-one dinner that he set up, there's been a lot of focus on that. But Donald Trump does that. He calls people, and he says, oh, let's sit down. Let's have dinner over it. If you want to have a conversation, let's have dinner over it. He's asked me to do that, and I don't think there's anything nefarious about it. I think it's his style.
INSKEEP: Although you say it was just a suggestion, Comey did not follow the suggestion and he was fired. That sounds like considerably more than a suggestion.
S. KING: Well, that's another linkage that, you know, we're hearing some of the press and the public put that link in there together. But if you step back and look at it, I think if Comey went forward with this investigation, and if he stepped up and did an announcement at some point that said I have completely cleared Trump and all of his affiliates and his campaign from any any kind of effort to cooperate or coordinate with Russian efforts to influence our election, that would not have exonerated Donald Trump because Comey was already too tainted.
If on the other way - on the other hand, if he had come forward and said I think there's some things here that we want to ask for serious charges on, then I think the other side of America would have said wait just a minute. Look what you - look at your history, Comey. So I think Comey was tainted. And I think it's a logical thing to say let's start fresh, although I do wish he hadn't fired him. It would be an easier position today, in my opinion.
INSKEEP: Let me ask about one other thing, and it's about what's missing from these conversations as written down by James Comey, these conversations between the president of the United States and the FBI director. We heard earlier today from Philip Mudd. He's a former CIA and FBI official. And he's read this testimony, and here's what he had to say about it.
PHILIP MUDD: There's a couple things that are missing here. The first is any suggestion that the commander in chief, that is the president, had a conversation with the FBI director about how to secure America for the next election. The conversation centers on how the president can protect himself in light of the allegations.
INSKEEP: The president really has not taken very seriously the Russian interference in this election and has repeatedly scorned and dismissed the charges. Do these conversations show the president focusing on himself and disregarding the country?
S. KING: Well, I know that the dates that we're referring to on these and, you know, focusing on his next election, I guess I'm a little surprised about that piece.
INSKEEP: Well, focusing on the allegations and getting out of the allegations is what Mudd says.
S. KING: Well, yes, for the purposes of the next election is I thought what I heard.
INSKEEP: OK.
S. KING: But in any case, it's, you know, again, it's the mindset of the president. And I would think that you can track through - this is James Comey's - the transcript of the testimony that he will deliver today, and it'll go into the record - into the official record. And you can string a lot of facts and events together and then cherry pick some of the pieces out of there and draw some conclusions. But I, you know, this is all without the president commenting on the language that's coming out there today. I will tell you that I have been impressed with James Comey's intelligence. I've - he's testified before me, and I've questioned him multiple times before committee. I don't doubt his ability.
And I think that, you know, maybe in another scenario he would have been a stellar individual. But right now, it's come to the place where he's become the subject, he's become the controversy. And I think President Trump following his instincts, which have served him very well in business and actually very, very well in politics, decided we need to remove this - James Comey from discussion and move forward. This country's got to move forward, and that's the most important part of this. We can't be denying the American people their mandate.
INSKEEP: Congressman Steve King, Republican of Iowa. Thanks for taking the time this morning, really appreciate it.
S. KING: Thank you, Steve.
INSKEEP: He's talking with us on this morning that James Comey will testify before the Senate intelligence committee.

In preview remarks, he says President Trump asked him to ease off of former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: 
One month after he was fired, former FBI Director James Comey is finally ready to tell his side of the story. Comey is testifying to the Senate intelligence committee later today. In an early preview of his remarks, Comey says President Trump asked him to lift the cloud of the Russia investigation and specifically to ease off on then-ousted former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn.
NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson joins us now. Good morning, Carrie.
CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.
MARTIN: So we get this unusual preview of Comey's testimony yesterday when the Senate intelligence committee released the prepared statement Comey's going to give. What stood out to you as you read through it?
JOHNSON: Well, Comey describes five meetings or one-on-one conversations he had with Donald Trump, suggesting he was under pressure from the president even before the inauguration. It all began with a session at Trump Tower in New York last year. Comey felt the need to immediately leave Trump Tower and take down notes on a laptop in the FBI car.
Rachel, this progressed into Washington after the inauguration. Donald Trump allegedly invited James Comey over for a one-on-one dinner, table set for two in the Green Room where Trump allegedly demanded Comey make a loyalty pledge. Comey didn't reply, and they had something of a staredown. Then, as you mentioned, there was later on a request to go light on former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.
MARTIN: So the president has denied this. Last month specifically, he denied leading on - leaning on anyone in law enforcement or otherwise to ease off on Flynn. So this is one man's word against another's.
JOHNSON: It is. It's going to be a bit of a credibility contest today between the former FBI director, who spent most of his career in law enforcement, and the president of the United States. That's why we're all really interested to hear James Comey tell his story in his own words. Then again, Comey did document his meetings with Trump contemporaneously at the time in a way he said he'd never done with President Obama, which means...
MARTIN: Which essentially means finishing the meeting and going immediately to write down what he remembers in detail.
JOHNSON: Yeah, absolutely. And James Comey - longtime law enforcement guy - even mentioned military steward's serving dinner and the fancy grandfather clock in the Oval Office, Rachel.
MARTIN: Yeah, lots of detail in there. So there is one thing Comey and the president apparently agree on. There's been a lot of back and forth about whether the FBI has been investigating President Trump personally. Does Comey clarify that in his prepared remarks?
JOHNSON: He does. Comey says he did tell Donald Trump he was not a personal focus of the Russia counterintelligence probe. But Comey says he was reluctant to say that in public in case Trump's status changed over the course of the investigation and the FBI would have to correct their record. In any event, Comey's firing triggered the Justice Department to name a special counsel who now may be investigating Comey's firing as possible obstruction of justice. And President Trump of course is the man who did that firing. So we don't have a lot of certainty now about President Trump's status.
MARTIN: Comey details these many one-on-one conversations with the president. So there's a lot of information already out there now. Senators had the benefit of reading that last night before they ask him questions. Where is the line of questioning going to go today? What else do they want to know?
JOHNSON: Well, I have a lot of questions. Comey only detailed 5 of 9 meetings he sat with Donald Trump. What happened in the rest? Are there bombshells in there he's going to talk about today or just some boring stuff? Comey also says Donald Trump was willing to concede some of his satellite aides in connection with his campaign may have legal exposure in Russia. Who and what, since Trump has repeatedly called that investigation a witch hunt? And Rachel, of course some of the Republican members of the Senate intelligence committee might try to beat up James Comey for being, in the president's words, a showboat and a grandstander and mishandling the Hillary Clinton email investigation last year.
MARTIN: And we do know this video has come out, put out by the administration trying to undermine James Comey's credibility, like a campaign ad. Are we expecting the president to weigh in on Comey's testimony today perhaps, I don't know, on social media?
JOHNSON: There's been a suggestion that President Trump might tweet today - not yet, though. His personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, says Comey's preview remarks vindicate the president who just wants to move forward with his agenda. Of course, Rachel, part of that agenda is getting a new FBI director. He named Chris Wray to the post in a surprise yesterday, and he needs a confirmation vote.
MARTIN: Carrie Johnson - she covers the Justice Department for us. Thanks, Carrie.
JOHNSON: You're welcome.

Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 5:30 p.m. ET 
Exit polls are projecting a loss of Conservative seats in the U.K. general election, in a blow to Prime Minister Theresa May and her party. Reuters reports that May will win 314 seats, short of the 326 needed for a majority in the 650-seat Parliament, according to exit polls released after voting ended Thursday.
If the projections are correct and the Conservatives lose their majority, May could remain prime minister. But it would require a coalition with other parties.
""If the poll is anything like accurate, this is completely catastrophic for the Conservatives and for Theresa May,"" former British Finance Minister George Osborne told ITV News, according to Reuters. ""It's difficult to see if these numbers were right, how they would put together the coalition to remain in office. But equally it's quite difficult looking at those numbers to see how Labour could put together a coalition, so it's on a real knife edge.""
The pound fell sharply, losing more than two cents against the dollar, after exit polls showed the Conservatives failing to keep their majority, The Associated Press reports.
NPR's Eleanor Beardsley, who watched the results from London, told All Things Considered that many in the room of journalists and political scientists where she was ""gasped and even yelled"" when the results came in, ""it was so shocking that she lost this many seats.""
Beardsley said that if projections hold, May will have to put together a coalition to govern, and a hung Parliament is possible. Just a month ago, Beardsley said, May was talking about winning a 100-seat majority.
Exit polls also projected major losses by Scottish nationalists, according to the AP, a hindrance to their plan to vote for independence.
May called for the snap election two months ago, and at the time, her party was expected to win by wide margins. In polls leading up to the campaign's final day, May's lead over Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was seen shrinking to 6 percentage points. Voting closed at 10 p.m. BST — or 5 p.m. ET.
May's Tories had been hoping to build on their small majority in the House of Commons, where they hold 330 of 650 seats. Explaining the surprise election announcement in April, she called it the ""only way to guarantee certainty and stability for the years ahead.""
Thursday's vote took place less than two weeks before the U.K. is to begin formal negotiations on leaving the European Union — the same issue that brought May into office last July, after the resignation of fellow Conservative David Cameron.
While the subject of Brexit was a main issue when the vote was scheduled, much of the campaign has focused not on Brexit, but on security after high-profile attacks on public spaces in Manchester and London. And in recent weeks, the Conservative Party's lead in polls has been cut in half.
""The third terrorist attack on May's watch has weakened her, especially after it came to light that she had cut 20,000 police officers as home minister,"" Beardsley reports.
Responding to criticism, May said this week that she'll push for tougher policies on prison sentences and deportations.
""If our human rights laws stop us from doing it, we'll change the laws so we can do it,"" May said .
By contrast, Corbyn has been gaining momentum despite a widely held belief that his Labour Party won't be able to force May out of No. 10 Downing St. On Wednesday, he promised to stand up to President Trump if he's elected.
As NPR's Frank Langfitt reports, ""[Corbyn] has been running a kind of Bernie Sanders-esque campaign, looking for a lot more funding for the National Health Service, which has really suffered. He's offering free higher education — so, really focusing on younger voters.""
Both May and Corbyn were criticized for notable absences on the campaign trail. For May, it was her refusal to take part in a debate on BBC TV , leaving Corbyn to spar with other members of her party. For Corbyn, it was his no-show at an event touting Labour's populist message — feeding suspicions that rivals in his own party may have been working against him.
May's voice was also used against her in a protest song that hit the Top 5 on Britain's charts, as the relatively unknown group Captain Ska interspersed May's comments on social issues with chants accusing her of lying on ""Liar Liar GE2017"" — referring to the general election by its initials.",U.K. Election Arrives After May Sees Lead Over Corbyn Shrink : The Two-Way : NPR,normal,dac0d00d7b68657b37d470793a21188baad5775a

A statement posted to his official Facebook page said Collins was left with a ""severe gash on his head close to his eye"" that required stitches after tripping on the way to his hotel bathroom on Wednesday night.
The statement said the singer-songwriter was ""recovering well,"" but would remain under observation for at least 24 hours.

To put this in context, the fired FBI director's hearing is just one of a handful of congressional hearings that have risen to the level of being broadcast live on network television, reports CBS News correspondent Chip Reid. 
In a 1954 hearing, Army lawyer Joseph Welch expressed frustration with Sen. Joseph McCarthy and his ruthless anti-Communist crusade. 
""Until this moment, senator, I think I never fully gauged your cruelty or your recklessness,"" Welch said in the hearing.

""Have you no sense of decency, sir?"" he also said. 
Presidential historian Robert Dallek remembers when then-Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson arranged for a television network to broadcast the congressional testimony. ""And Johnson knew this: that once they saw McCarthy with his five o'clock shadow… and having people see how rude and abusive he could be… it undercut him terribly,"" Dallek said. 
Years later in 1966, the Vietnam hearings exposed a stunning admission.""I think our military involvement in Vietnam has to be recognized as unfortunate, as something we would not choose deliberately if the choice were ours to make all over again today,"" Ambassador George Kennan said.

The U.S. was stuck in a war it was unlikely to win.""It raised questions about what was the purpose of it? Why were we fighting there?"" Dallek said.

Experts say the most damning statement in Comey’s written testimony concerns former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn, who was under investigation for making false statements about contacts with Russian officials. 
Trump asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other top government officials to leave the Oval Office on Feb. 14 before urging Comey to drop the investigation of Flynn. “I hope you can let this go,” Trump said, according to Comey’s testimony. 
WATCH LIVE: James Comey to testify in Senate hearing on Russia 
Ryan Goodman, a New York University law professor, called that statement “the most devastating revelation” in Comey’s testimony. The former director “is now on record saying that the president tried to impede the investigation of Flynn,” Goodman said. 
Julie O’Sullivan, a former federal prosecutor who teaches at Georgetown University’s law school, said Trump’s decision to clear the room before talking to Comey is evidence that suggests that Trump “was aware that what he was doing was a problem.” 
Trump has previously denied that he told Comey to end the investigation. 
Obstruction of justice is a federal crime, though it’s an open question whether a sitting president can be prosecuted. It’s also an impeachable offense, though Republicans who control Congress are extremely unlikely to go after a president of their own party. 
James Comey’s reported disclosure that President Trump allegedly asked him to drop an FBI investigation has raised the question of — and plenty of disagreement over — whether that request may constitute obstruction of justice. John Yang gets reaction to that and the naming of a special counsel from William Jeffress of Baker Botts LLP and Michael Waldman of the Brennan Center for Justice. 
But a former FBI official and a prominent Washington, D.C., law professor said they don’t see a crime in what Comey reported that Trump said. Instead, the document reveals a president woefully ignorant of standard protocol and of the historic wall of independence between the FBI and the White House, an inexperience that could work in his favor and make his actions simply improper instead of actually illegal. 
“I think the request is inappropriate,” said Andrew Arena, a retired senior FBI official. “Whether it crosses that threshold to being criminal, I’m not there yet.” 
Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, said nothing he read in Comey’s statement convinces him that Trump violated the law by interfering with a federal investigation. “Sounding like Tony Soprano does not make you Tony Soprano,” Turley said. “We do not indict people for being boorish or clueless.” 
Associated Press writers Sam Hananel and Eric Tucker contributed to this report.","Legal experts say Trump comments in Comey testimony are inappropriate, maybe worse",normal,b9434bb909c621fce0c707f424b905810ad3d6d8

There is nothing extraordinary about this demand, in other words, more than a duty, being faithful to the President of the USA is an obligation. Because ""being faithful to the President of the USA"", means being faithful to the whole nation, and therefore to the millions of Americans,

They will train for two years before qualifying for space travel, which could include missions aboard commercially-built spacecraft from private companies like SpaceX. 
NASA is counting on SpaceX to bring cargo , and eventually astronauts to the International Space Station, while SpaceX relies on NASA contracts and its launch pad. 
Complete with a Hollywood soundtrack, for years, NASA has promoted plans to send humans into deep space.
But its ""Space Launch System"" won't be ready to bring humans around the moon until at least 2021, reports CBS News' Manuel Bojorquez.  
So, it came as a surprise to NASA when SpaceX founder Elon Musk held a conference call in February announcing plans to use a powerful rocket that hasn't yet flown to sling private tourists around the moon next year --an ambitious timeline, according to Mary Lynne Dittmar who represents some of SpaceX's competitors through the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration.
""If you're putting all the schedule pressure on, you are essentially -- you're automatically assuming more risk. You're automatically creating an environment where you are operating at higher risk because you have to meet the deadline,"" Dittmar explained. 
Dittmar said she is concerned about the 2018 deadline for SpaceX.
Play Video SciTech Watch: SpaceX Dragon docks with space station NASA video shows the SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule arriving at the International Space Station to deliver 6,000 pounds of supplies and equipment. 
The company is already busy launching commercial satellites while working on a NASA contract to launch astronauts to the International Space Station.
NASA has relied on Russia for rides to space ever since its shuttle program ended in 2011.
""Not anything against the Russians, but it would be good to have Americans that are able to move back and forth now from Earth to space using our own vehicles,"" Dittmar said. 
The bigger prize is Mars . Both NASA and SpaceX are working separately on plans to get to the red planet.
""Do you see any scenario where NASA and these companies might be stepping on each other's toes at all?"" Bojorquez asked Charles Miller, the president of NexGen Space. 
""Well, yes. People have to re-learn the dance steps, right?"" Miller said. 
Miller advised President Trump's NASA transition team to embrace competition between traditional aerospace contractors and companies like SpaceX. It seems to have worked. Mr. Trump's proposed budget for NASA in 2018 ""increases cooperation with industry"". 
""It is my belief that the human space flight endeavor of NASA will collapse unless we get more innovation from American free enterprise,"" Miller said.  
Acting NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot  appeared to agree. 
 ""We want big companies, we want small companies, we want everybody to come to help us do this, because this journey is hard,"" Lightfoot said.  
Yet some basic differences still have to be resolved. A NASA safety group raised concerns about SpaceX's plans to fuel its rockets with humans on board after an explosion while fueling an unmanned rocket last year. Dittmar worries any disaster involving SpaceX could have larger implications for the future of space exploration.
""Might people extrapolate from that, well, this is so dangerous nobody should be doing it?"" Dittmar asked. ""I think there is that danger. I would hope not. You know, I would hope that people wouldn't go down that road, but I do worry about it.""
SpaceX declined to comment for this story. Elon Musk has defended the fueling process and he says the company is doing everything it can to minimize risks. Later this year, SpaceX is planning to test the larger version of its Falcon Rocket -- the one that will eventually carry tourists going around the moon.",Could NASA and SpaceX cooperation turn into competition? - CBS This Morning,normal,b91017599e798a56d7ec172cfaa6c4d2795cff31

PALM BEACH, Fla. — The properties in President Donald Trump's real estate empire that sit just feet from the encroaching seawater of South Florida may suffer from his decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. 
The president's Mar-a-Lago estate, the soaring apartment towers bearing his name on Miami-area beaches and his Doral golf course are all threatened by rising seas, according to projections from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the South Florida Regional Climate Change Compact. 
Severe damage may come sooner rather than later if the U.S. abandons the international agreement aimed at curbing emissions of heat-trapping gases that cause climate change. 
""His properties live off of tourism — golfing communities, places where fat cats go and spend money and hobnob. It's all related to the tourism economy in South Florida,"" said Jim Cason, the Republican mayor of Coral Gables, a small city south of Miami that is aggressively planning for sea-level rise. 
South Florida roadways already flood routinely during storms or unusually high ""king tides,"" forcing cities to raise or move them and install expensive pumping systems. 
""If the beaches are gone or the streets are flooded, it's going to affect the value of his property,"" Cason added. ""So as a prudent businessman, he ought to conclude that the science is right and we need to prepare and plan."" 
Trump's 123-room Mar-a-Lago mansion and private club sit on a barrier island with the Atlantic Ocean to the east and Florida's Intracoastal Waterway to the west. If the sea level climbs by 2 or 3 feet in this century — an amount that falls squarely within scientists' predictions — that would push seawater onto the mansion's western lawns. Nearby roads and bridges used to access the property would also be affected. News of President Trump's decision to back out of the Paris climate accords traveled quickly, making it all the way to Kiribati, a small island i... 
At some point this century, water is expected to completely cover many of the state's barrier islands, especially during storms. 
Trump's beloved National Doral Miami golf course is inland, but it's still at risk. As seas rise and Florida's water table rises, state geologists predict that Florida's porous limestone geology will allow water to easily percolate upward, flooding inland and coastal areas alike. If the course isn't severely damaged by flooding, there will be more days when it's too swamped for golfers. 
The commander in chief's sea-level headache doesn't end in Florida. The Trump International Hotel & Tower in Waikiki Beach, Hawaii, is vulnerable too, as is his golf course in Ireland. The president also has business interests in properties near the ocean in Vancouver, Canada; Panama City, Panama; Uruguay and Mumbai, India, according to the Trump Organization website. 
But the problem is especially fraught in Florida. Using the worst-case prediction of a 6-foot sea rise, real estate data provider Zillow estimates that 934,000 of the state's homes, or nearly 12.6 percent, will be underwater by 2100. In Palm Beach, which includes Mar-a-Lago, about 51 percent of homes worth a total of $10.9 billion would be underwater, according to the data. 
""We're already in for a sea-level rise that will put all low-lying coastal areas out of business, and that's using U.S. government projections,"" said Harold Wanless, chairman of the University of Miami's Department of Geological Science, who has been studying sea-level rise for decades. ""At some point in the not-too-distant future, we'll be leaving Miami ... we're all moving somewhere."" 
So far, the threat of rising seas has not affected property values on Florida's coast. Flood insurance rates are already high because of hurricane risks, but that hasn't stopped the wealthy from investing in beachfront property.

But since we have to drive, wouldn't it be great to know the very worst day of the week and the most dangerous hour to be out on the interstate as a target for automotive mayhem during these hectic months?
Now we do. EverQuote: , an online insurance marketplace, has just completed its second annual survey of the most dangerous times and conditions for driving in America. The results are based on its EverDrive app , which recorded more than 20 million vehicle trips and 230 million miles driven. This voluntary app allows your cellphone to measure your global position, acceleration and whether your devices are on or off. It can even tell if your phone is in your shaky hand.
Here are some of its findings:
About 10 percent of all drives include speeding, and traveling well over the posted speed limit 9 percent of the time. On a 21-minute average trip, such as dropping the kids off at school, that adds up to two minutes of speeding. And at 55 miles an hour, that equates to distracted driving over the length of 17 football fields, EverQuote: claimed.
With fewer cars on the road, ""early birds"" speed the most, on more than half the trips between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. In fact, more than two-thirds of the cars on the road between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. were found to be speeding.
However, when it came to cellphone use , the afternoon driving hours were the most chatty. Between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m., 68 percent of drivers were using their phone for calls, texting or social media, in some cases defying state laws. Women were the biggest offenders, using their phones in four out of 10 rides. The same grim statistic was true for people under the age of 21, who have the most casualties on the road (and pay the highest insurance rates).
Thursday and Friday were the days when distracted driving occurred most frequently. Friday is also the day when people -- in a hurry to get home or on to their vacation -- put pedal to the metal and accelerated the most. Risky acceleration occurred during 15 percent of their drives. EveQuote: is also initiating its second ""Safe Driving Challenge"" that awards a $1,000 scholarship to the safest driver in each state. Of course, that means downloading the EverDrive app and perhaps being one of those ""bad driver"" statistics -- if you're not careful.",Here's when you don't want to be on the road,normal,94af2f2891d1dbffa643c14a5e478d300ce04a43

""Sam, his death was my fault, like honestly, I could have stopped him,"" read texts Boardman received from Carter. ""I was on the phone and he got out of the car because it was working and he got scared and I told him to get back in …. they read my messages with him, I'm done. His family will hate me and I could go to jail."" 
CBS Boston reports that Bates testified that Carter discussed methods of suicide with Roy, including taking sleeping pills. 
On cross examination, Bates admitted there had been other texts in which Carter tried to help Roy with his depression. 
According to the station, Carter's defense has argued that she tried to talk Roy into getting help–but they say she got wrapped up in his plan, and that he would have committed suicide regardless. 
Two other friends say Carter texted them saying she was on the phone with Roy as he died. 
""I was talking on the phone with him when he killed himself ... I heard him die,"" Carter texted to Olivia Mosolgo days after Roy's death, Mosolgo testified. 
Carter also expressed remorse in a message to a friend: ""I'm the only one he told things too. I should have gotten him more help,"" she wrote. 
The police detective who conducted the criminal investigation also testified. Fairhaven Detective Scott Gordon said he found Roy's phone and discovered the text conversation between Roy and Carter. 
The case is being tried without a jury, and a judge will deliver the verdict. The judge visited the site where Roy's truck was found on Wednesday afternoon. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.

Comey, in testimony to the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, said his decision to have his memos shared publicly came after Trump tweeted last month that Comey had ""better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!""

Comey testified that he asked ""a good friend of mine who's a professor at Columbia Law School"" to provide the contents of a memo to an unnamed reporter. He didn't identify Richman to the committee. 
Related: Live Blog: Comey Testifies About Trump, Russia 
Comey added that because his writings were unclassified he felt he could share them but didn't want to do it personally with the media. ""I was worried it would be like feeding seagulls at the beach,"" he told senators. Daniel Richman, a professor at Columbia Law School in New York, testifies before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on Sept. 18, 2007, in Washington. Stephanie Kuykendal / Bloomberg via Getty Images file 
Ultimately, he said, he wanted his memo released because ""I thought it might prompt the appointment of a special counsel."" The day after, it was announced that former FBI Director Bob Mueller would become special counsel . 
Comey's discussions with Trump are part of the committee's larger inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in last year's election. 
Trump fired Comey on May 9, a week before the memos were leaked. The leaked memo said that Trump had asked him to shut down an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, raising questions about potential obstruction of justice by the president. 
Richman and Comey’s ties run deep, and the pair has been friends for 30 years, the law professor told NBC News last fall. 
Richman is a former federal prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and has been a consultant with the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury, according to his Columbia biography . Among his areas of expertise are criminal adjudication and federal criminal law. 
His bio also lists him as an adviser to Comey and says his ""scholarly writings include more than 30 law review articles. He has offered testimony as an expert in a number of congressional hearings, and state, federal, and international criminal and civil matters."" 
Richman was a vocal supporter of Comey last fall, as the FBI director revealed in October that the bureau was reviewing a new batch of emails linked to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton that appeared to be pertinent to the earlier investigation into her use of a private server. 
""I don't think he takes glee in being contrary for its own sake,"" Richman told NBC News at the time. 
Richman said he’s sure that politics didn’t play a part when Comey decided to re-examine Clinton's emails. 
""When you have an obligation to disclose or to qualify, you do it full-stop,"" Richman added. ""You don't worry about timing, you don't worry about how it will be read or spun by others."" 
Richman could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday. Erik Ortiz ","Who Is Daniel Richman, the Columbia Professor Who Leaked Comey's Trump Memo? - NBC News",normal,30a125ac6e6e71077956872b7e80c7098981eabb

A day after the twin terrorist attacks in Tehran, Iranian state media said the death toll has risen to 17 and Iran's foreign minister denounced the official White House response as ""repugnant."" 
Iran's Intelligence Ministry also identified five extremists who attacked the Parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Wednesday and confirmed that they had fought for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. 
Two teams of attackers armed with guns and explosives targeted the Parliament building and the mausoleum in apparently coordinated attacks that occurred within an hour of each other. Twin Attacks Hit Iran's Parliament And Khomeini Mausoleum; ISIS Claims Responsibility 
Five of the attackers died and, Reuters reports, more than half a dozen suspects have been arrested in connection with the assault — the first major attack Iran has experienced in years. 
Iran initially said a dozen victims died; it's unclear whether the toll announced Thursday includes the five attackers. Dozens of people were wounded. 
Meanwhile, President Trump's statement on the attack has prompted criticism in Iran. The statement from the White House read in full: 
""We grieve and pray for the innocent victims of the terrorist attacks in Iran, and for the Iranian people, who are going through such challenging times. We underscore that states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote."" 
That second sentence, suggesting Iran bears responsibility for an attack against its civilians, was not well-received, NPR's Peter Kenyon reports. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad-Zarif called it ""repugnant"" on Twitter and said the Iranian people ""reject"" the statement. 
Other parts of Trump's administration have been striving to moderate that message. NPR's Michele Kelemen notes that the State Department condemned the attack and wrote that ""the depravity of terrorism has no place in a peaceful, civilized world."" 
The United States and several allies in the Middle East have been fighting against the Islamic State. Iran also has been fiercely opposed to the militant group. Iran is a majority-Shiite nation, and the Islamic State is a Sunni group that often targets Shiite Muslims. 
Iran has indirectly suggested that Saudi Arabia, its major regional rival and a U.S. ally, played a role in the attack. 
Iran's Revolutionary Guards have suggested that the attack was linked to Saudi Arabia. They never named the country directly, but the implication was clear. Their statement, according to a Financial Times translation and annotation, read: ""This terrorist act took place a week after a joint meeting between the US president and head of a reactionary regional country [Saudi Arabia] which has been a constant supporter of terrorism. ... The fact ISIS claimed responsibility proves that they [Saudi Arabia] were involved in the brutal attack."" 
Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi told IRNA on Thursday that it is clear Saudi Arabia supports terrorist groups but it is too soon to say whether it was involved in the Parliament and mausoleum strikes.

IDFA 2016 | Trailer | Nowhere to Hide by IDFA on YouTube The opening night feature at the festival (on Friday, June 9) is the New York premiere of the fascinating ""Nowhere to Hide,"" a powerful first-hand look at the effects that war and the ISIS insurgency in Iraq have had upon the population.
In 2011 director Zaradascht Ahmed gave a video camera to Nori Sharif, a nurse at a hospital in Jalawla, who captured the lives of his family and the medical staff before and after the withdrawal of American and Iraqi forces, and the rise of militia and ISIS fighters. After staying to help those that remain in the midst of the takeover of the city, Sharif and his family flee, joining the thousands of displaced refugees whose lives have been ripped apart.
The film will open in New York on June 23, and on June 30 in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Toronto and Vancouver, with other cities to follow.
Winner: 2017 Nestor Almendros Award for courage in filmmaking; 2016 IDFA Winner for Best Feature-Length Documentary.

The closing night feature (June 19) is Brian Knappenberger's ""Nobody Speak: Trials of the Free Press."" The thought- and anger-provoking film honors journalistic freedom and the threats it faces from powerful and well-funded corporate and political forces.
The narrative evolves from two fascinating challenges to the First Amendment: the lawsuit, funded by venture capitalist Peter Thiel, aimed at the website Gawker for publishing a Hulk Hogan sex tape; and the purchase by Las Vegas casino owner Sheldon Adelson of the Las Vegas Review-Journal and the efforts by the paper's new management to stifle critical stories.
The lesson from the film: never take free speech for granted, and be very careful when anyone -- politician, pundit, lawyer -- tries to draw a line in the sand between what is constitutionally-protected speech and what isn't.
""Nobody Speak"" will be released in select cities and available to stream via Netflix on June 23.

A day after the twin terrorist attacks in Tehran, Iranian state media said the death toll has risen to 17 and Iran's foreign minister denounced the official White House response as ""repugnant."" 
Iran's Intelligence Ministry also identified five extremists who attacked the Parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Wednesday and confirmed that they had fought for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. 
Two teams of attackers armed with guns and explosives targeted the Parliament building and the mausoleum in apparently coordinated attacks that occurred within an hour of each other. Twin Attacks Hit Iran's Parliament And Khomeini Mausoleum; ISIS Claims Responsibility 
Five of the attackers died and, Reuters reports, more than half a dozen suspects have been arrested in connection with the assault — the first major attack Iran has experienced in years. 
Iran initially said a dozen victims died; it's unclear whether the toll announced Thursday includes the five attackers. Dozens of people were wounded. 
Meanwhile, President Trump's statement on the attack has prompted criticism in Iran. The statement from the White House read in full: 
""We grieve and pray for the innocent victims of the terrorist attacks in Iran, and for the Iranian people, who are going through such challenging times. We underscore that states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote.""

LONDON -- Dramatic video footage released Thursday captures the moment when armed police swooped into a busy market area near London Bridge on Saturday night and shot dead three attackers who had just left a trail of bloodshed, killing eight people and wounding scores. 
The surveillance camera footage shows the first police car rolling forward as the attackers lunge at a man to stab him during the late night attacks. Within minutes, the attackers are shot dead and another police car arrives as people are seen running for their lives. One police officer is seen kicking the body of one of the dead attackers. 
Who were the London attackers? Chef, clerk and ""suspicious"" Italian 
During the confrontation, passers-by can be seen throwing objects at the attackers before the last victim is shown stumbling away. Shortly later, the lifeless bodies of the attackers are seen on the pavement. Some 48 rounds were fired to stop the attack within eight minutes. 
As investigators hunted for potential accomplices linked to the three attackers on Thursday, voters cast ballots in a general election that has spotlighted security concerns. 
Police briefly closed off an area of London near Charing Cross train station after a suspicious package was found. The Metropolitan Police said the package was not terror-related in the end. There have been increased security patrols throughout London. 
Saturday's attack was the third such deadly incident in England in just three months. 
Police also carried out raids to several properties in east London on Wednesday and Thursday. Six men were arrested - three in connection to London Bridge attack. One of the arrests included a man who allegedly worked out at the same gym as 27-year-old Khurum Butt, thought to be the attack ringleader. The two other attackers were named as 22-year-old Youssef Zaghba and 30-year-old Rachid Redouane. British police said two incidents, one on London Bridge and one at nearby Borough Market, are being treated as terrorist incidents 
Butt, once seen in a documentary called ""The Jihadis Next Door,"" had been repeatedly reported to police for his violent behavior and reports from a neighbor who said he was trying to lure young kids to radical Islam. His name had also been flagged in 2015 by FBI informant Jesse Morton who told authorities he had met Butt in an extremist internet chatroom used by Anjem Choudary, one of Europe's most prolific hate preachers who was jailed last year for his support of the Islamic State group, according to a British government official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about the ongoing attack investigation. 
Born in Pakistan, Butt's family in Britain released a statement on Wednesday apologizing for his actions. Relatives in Pakistan, meanwhile, said he had brought shame on to the family. 
The Italian mother of Zaghba, whose father was Moroccan, said Wednesday that her son had become radicalized in Britain after falling in with the wrong group of friends. Italian authorities alerted their British counterparts after he bought a one-way ticket to Turkey. He had said he wanted to go to Syria to start a family, according to his mother. 
Redouane, a Moroccan pastry chef who had married a British woman and lived in Ireland for some time, was the only one of the three attackers who had not come onto British security's radar. 
London's Borough Market remained sealed off Thursday with only a scattering of businesses opening nearby. The market was unlikely to open before Sunday, according to police. 
One of the businesses to re-open was Leon. On the night of the attack, staff pretended to lock the doors in a move that was thought to protect 20 customers inside. One customer outside the shop was stabbed several times in the neck. 
""Some of the people who were here on Saturday night are still a bit fragile,"" said John Vincent, the CEO and founder of Leon. ""Some people who weren't here on Saturday night have got this whole guilt thing going on that they weren't here to be supportive to their colleagues."" 
As detectives searched for clues in Saturday's attack, the investigation continued into last month's Manchester arena suicide bombing that killed 22 people and injured scores during an Ariana Grande concert. 
A Libyan counterterrorism official said Thursday that the brother of the Manchester arena suicide bomber knew he was planning something, and that his radicalization took root when he was living in the city in 2015. 
Libyan counterterrorism official Ahmed bin Salem said that Salman Abedi's younger brother Hashim was still being held for questioning in Libya. Abedi's father, who allegedly belonged to an al-Qaida backed militant group, was also being held in Libya. 
On Sunday, Grande performed during a benefit concert , which aimed to raise money for the victims of the deadly attack. 
Bin Salem said there were no apparent links between Abedi and the London Bridge attackers. 
Meanwhile, Britain's counter-terror chiefs said they are launching a major drive to train festival workers in the wake of the three deadly attacks. 
The measures were announced as the summer music season gets into full swing. The Glastonbury music and arts festival starts this month. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON — Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, who led a two-year investigation into the deadly 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, is set to take over leadership of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
The House Republican Steering Committee on Thursday recommended Gowdy for the chairmanship, replacing Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who is leaving Congress at the end of the month. Gowdy beat out Oklahoma Rep. Steve Russell. The full House Republican conference is expected to confirm the choice next week.
Gowdy, 52, a former state and federal prosecutor, led the Benghazi inquiry that focused on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and was an outspoken critic of the Obama administration. As the new chairman, he will lead oversight of the Trump administration, including a budding investigation into possible ties between Russia and President Donald Trump’s campaign.

“Trey Gowdy possesses the experience and deep commitment to transparency and accountability necessary to be the House’s next Oversight chairman,” Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement. “He has proven that he will always look out for taxpayers and seek answers from the bureaucracy. Trey has my absolute confidence, and I know he will do an outstanding job.”
Gowdy, in a statement, said he was “grateful” for “this opportunity to serve.” The statement made no mention of specific lines of inquiry.
Chaffetz is stepping down June 30 to pursue a private-sector career amid questions about willingness of the Republican Congress to conduct oversight of Trump.
Gowdy, in his fourth term representing upstate South Carolina, is less senior than several Republican colleagues on the oversight panel but is well-liked by Ryan and other GOP leaders, with a high-profile earned as chairman of the select committee on Benghazi and a reputation as a sharp questioner.
GOP lawmakers trust Gowdy, “and he’s going to do a fantastic job.” – Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga. Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga., a Steering Committee member who nominated Gowdy for the oversight post, said Gowdy’s background as a prosecutor and leader of the Benghazi panel “perfectly suits him for this chairmanship.”
GOP lawmakers trust Gowdy, “and he’s going to do a fantastic job,” Graves said.
Chaffetz, who doggedly investigated Clinton before the 2016 presidential election but declined for months to investigate Trump, said in April that he won’t run for re-election.
Chaffetz, a close friend, called Gowdy “the right person for the job” and said he has a history of demanding accountability.
Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the senior Democrat on Oversight, congratulated Gowdy in a statement and promised to “support his efforts whenever we can.” The two men served on the Benghazi panel, where Cummings also was the top Democrat. They initially pledged to work together, but their relationship descended into partisan bickering by the time the investigation ended last summer.
Chaffetz is leaving the oversight panel just as it was poised to investigate Trump’s firing of former FBI Director James Comey amid the FBI’s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible connections between Russia and the Trump campaign.
Chaffetz has asked the FBI to turn over documents about Comey’s interactions with the White House and Justice Department, including materials dating back nearly four years to the Obama administration. Trump fired Comey May 9 amid questions about the FBI’s investigation, which is now being overseen by special counsel Robert Mueller, a former FBI director. Comey testified Thursday before the Senate intelligence committee about his interactions with Trump.

The Saudis, meanwhile, are so anxious about Iran, that they are falling into traps which are causing them to break up their own coalition, piece by piece. I would guess that this is one part of his daily briefing which Trump skips in order to sneak in an extra tweet.
Meanwhile, you have to go to the BBC site to find out that a major ISIS terror attack was launched in ---- wait for it ---- Iran. The attackers actually penetrated the Parliament building. While I do not care about the additional physical damage to the Khomeini monument, the human casualties are the same wherever ISIS strikes.
I do not subscribe to the idea that the Saudi secular government supports ISIS (after all, they are a specific target of ISIS) their conservative religious leaders foster the kind of climate which inspires some of the ISIS leadership. But this is the Middle East. It is harder than Trump thought, and getting harder thanks to his blind blustering.

-..there are strong inflationary pressures for EU and USA
- EU and USA are in front of secular recession. Check DSGE prognoses
- for growth yearly bellow 2 % yearly and high inflation the stock exchange markets indexes decline for USA
- EU banks are bankrupted , USA nearly deleted all their value
- data is cheated so that the USA and EU economies are lemons and better price of stocks and other assets can be obtained. Government and companies participate organized..in collision. 
There were strong transfer of EU deposits to USA and the World to diversify the risk. Some 4 trillions out of 14 trillion deposits , left EU , that are mainly big non guaranteed deposits. That is seen from some 1 trillion transferred to Italy and Spain coming as..illegal money printing from Germany according to Target 2 data. There must be also liquidity provided for deposits leaving Germany, UK and France as well as other EU countries that should make some 4 trillions totaL.
Similar ERSTE speculative banks in Serbia and Hungary lost big deposits , but Greece also some small due to big government debt. Probably only Italy cannot cover bellow 100 000 EUR deposits. So to refinance 4 trillion deposits with some 30 , 60 % default risk EU banks need similar amount to lost deposits as additional costs.
Europeans hold some trillion EUR in safes, FED probably some 3 trillions..EUR currency reserves now,..Other currency reserves are 1.5 trillions EUR. Buying EUR from FED is illegal monetary policy , but FED may steal EU deposits though at lower EUR. So FED will start to return EUR as big deposits end that is soon as..Europeans diversified to Asia . Then Europeans and foreign reserves will also decline up to 5 trillion out of some 10 trillion M2 money aggregate for EU that is a third decline of currency value and 50 % inflation. There is no expectation for inflation from 2010 to 2015 for EU. Logically there is..observed high inflation , though growth is probably cheated.
USA citizens also hold a trillion in safes from QE ...USD currency reserves are 4.75 trillions. There is also observed high inflation though growth is probably cheated.
There is 20..% expectation for inflation from 2010 to 2015 for USA as M2 aggregate growth over prices and GDP...So some 3 trillion money to be returned ,..is 15 % decline of currency value. Inflation will..be some 20 % plus..for up..to 2005 with some..some 18 % added recently from QE. 
Usa banks lose
- part of loans for some 200 bn loss from fraking
- part of EU bad credits due to currency crisis some 5 % from a trillion is 50 bn
-..shares some decline..to normal historic pe..ratio some 20 % so part of 25 trillions banks..hold out of 5 trillions.
- some part of sovereign and corpora te bonds decline if growth disappoint 10 % of price is 3.4 trillions , the..part the..banks..holdings
in decline , to cover social..costs USA and EU will print money, as additional public loans are impossible. The decline will be very severe for EU with trillions of deposits to refinance.

Videographer: Jamie McDonald 
Mount Rainier is one of sixteen volcanoes on the worldwide ""Decade Volcanoes"" list, and is one of only two volcanoes on that list in the U.S. The Decade Volcanoes list was composed by the International Association of Volcanology and the Chemistry of the Earth's Interior (IAVCE) , ""to direct attention to a small number of selected, active volcanoes worldwide and to encourage the establishment of a range of research and public-awareness activities aimed at enhancing an understanding of the volcanoes and the hazards posed by them."" 
It is basically a list of the deadliest volcanoes on Earth, those that, because of their potential to erupt and proximity to large population centers, are most likely to affect the largest number of people and their property. (The list is named for the 1990-2000 decade that was considered the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.) 
Mount Rainier is on the IAVCE's list because it is a large, active volcano with hundreds of thousands of people living in the valleys around it. It last erupted in 1894-95, but may at any time begin producing lava flows, ash or huge lahars (a mixture of mudflow made up of lava, ash, rock, soil and water). USGS 
But the potentially deadly mountain drapes itself with beauty. The lower slopes of Mount Rainier are covered in diverse forests with many species of wildflowers. One of the less common early spring wildflowers is the calypso orchid or fairy slipper. It, like so many orchids, is non-rewarding to its pollinators (that is, it doesn't produce any nectar). Calypso orchids practice pollination by deception. Bumblebees, its most common pollinators, are attracted to the orchids anther-like yellow hairs but quickly learn to avoid them when they don't find any nectar. Therefore, pollination is uncommon and is one of the reason calypsos are either threatened or endangered in several U.S. states. My husband once spent two weeks sitting in front of a group of calypso orchids waiting for a pollinator. During that entire two weeks he got two photos of bumblebees on the orchids, as well as a bunch of mosquito bites. 
Calypso orchids. Verne Lehmberg 
A late springtime visitor to Mount Rainier might suddenly find themselves surrounded by elephants, more specifically pink elephants. Don't be alarmed. These elephants are actually a diminutive wildflower, the beautiful pink elephant's head or elephant's head lousewort. It is well-named as each small flower looks just like an elephant's face complete with a curved-up trunk and lateral petal lobes forming the elephant's ears. 
The name lousewort is derived from either the belief that this plant gave grazing animals lice or it was used to cure lice, depending on which source is accurate. Elephant head plants have less chlorophyll than most because it is a root parasite. It steals nutrients from other plants by piercing its small rootlets, or haustoria, into the roots of host plants. 
Fireweed. Verne Lehmberg 
Fireweed, common in mid- to late-summer is often found after a fire has burned through an area. It is a pioneer species -- one that grows quickly in open areas with little competition from other plants. In the past I was always sad seeing fireweed blooming while traveling in the northern U.S., knowing it would soon be time to head back to the hot South to begin another semester. Now that I am semi-retired, I greet fireweed flowers with joy knowing it will soon be time for the tourists to go home and I get to stay in the cool North. 
An Alaskan nurse once gave me a recipe for fireweed jelly. It took a while to collect enough flowers, but it made the most delicately-flavored and beautifully-colored jelly I've ever made. 
Judy Lehmberg is a former college biology teacher who now shoots nature videos.

Graduate on time.
At four-year schools, only about 40% of full-time students graduate on time, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, part of the U.S. Department of Education.
For some students, it is because they sign up for too few courses in certain semesters and don’t earn enough credits in time. Other students can enroll in too many courses that don’t count toward a degree. In still other cases, students have to work to cover their expenses, which sometimes interferes with studies.
Such delays add up. An additional year of school in a public four-year college will cost $22,826, on average, according to the nonprofit Complete College America. Then there is lost income to consider. Students who stay in school an additional year miss out on about $45,327 in salary, on average.
All told, Complete College America estimates that an extra year of college can cost as much as $68,153.
More colleges and universities are trying to improve their on-time graduation rates. The move, some say, is a response to the rising cost of tuition and stagnating family incomes. But it also makes financial sense for the schools. When students are on track to graduate on time, dropout rates fall and revenues rise.
Many new initiatives urge students to earn more credits each semester. To that end, a number of colleges now charge a flat rate for a semester, rather than charge by the credit. Adams State University in Alamosa, Colo., revised its tuition policy so that students pay the same for 20 credits as they pay for 12, and have an incentive to take a heavier course load. Also, its tuition won’t increase for four consecutive years for full-time students.
“We are trying keep the cost of education as low as possible,” says Karla Hardesty, director of marketing and enrollment management at Adams State.
The average course load for degree-seeking undergraduates at Adams State rose 11% between the fall of 2010 and the fall of 2015, according to school officials. The university’s goal is to have more than 20% of its students graduate in four years by 2020. For the freshman class of 2009, the rate was 11%.
Focus on 15 Students at many colleges take 12 credits a semester, or 24 credits a year, which is considered full time by federal financial-aid programs. But students usually need 30 credits a year to earn the necessary 120 credits to graduate on time.
If students start taking more credits from the outset, education experts say, it sets a precedent that is likely to stay with them throughout their time at school. Students at four-year schools who took 15 credits their first semester or 30 credits their first year were more likely to graduate than students who attempted 12 or 24 credits, according to a recent study of data from Tennessee public colleges.
“The longer students stretch out their studies, the more life intervenes and the more likely students won’t finish,” says Davis Jenkins, co-author of the study and senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Teachers College. The report also found that students who stayed the course paid $52 (14%) less per credit and $13,310 (20%) less per degree.
Some states have made enrolling in 30 credits a year a requirement to receive state scholarship money. New York state’s Excelsior scholarship, included in the 2018 state budget, requires recipients to enroll in 30 credits. Indiana’s 21st Century Scholar and Frank O’Brian Grant, both approved by the Indiana General Assembly in 2013, also predicate funding on earning 30 credits.
Miami-based Florida International University this fall will start encouraging students to consider earning credits in summer. Promoting a summer semester may offer more flexibility for students who work and attend classes, says Elizabeth Bejar, vice president for academic affairs.
Congress made it possible for more students to attend summer sessions when it signed an appropriations package last month that included an amendment to the Higher Education Act allowing students to use Pell Grants year round.
Guided pathways In another approach to helping more students graduate in four years, some schools now require, or encourage, picking an area of study as early as possible. Degree maps, which show all of the courses required for each major (in the right sequence), are promoted on some college websites and through introductory courses.
“Students should be clear on what to do and when, not just handed a book and told to figure it out,” says Courtney Brown, vice president at the Lumina Foundation, a private foundation that works to make higher education more available.
One big reason for failing to graduate on time, experts say, is that certain required courses aren’t offered frequently enough for all students who need them to enroll.
The University of Texas in Austin uses data from academic transcripts and personal records to identify the 25% of students least likely to graduate on time. Photo: ​Callie Richmond Temple University, based in Philadelphia, works to prevent such situations with its Fly in 4 Graduation Partnership, an agreement that offers certain safeguards but requires students to be proactive in their class scheduling. To participate, students must be full-time freshmen or transfer students who begin in a fall semester, and they must agree to complete 30 credits a year. The students are also required to meet with an academic adviser at least once a semester, register early each semester and let advisers know immediately when a required course isn’t available so that a possible solution can be found.
For a Fly in 4 student who meets all of his or her obligations but still fails to graduate on time because a required course wasn’t available at the necessary time, Temple says the student can complete his or her degree requirements fee and tuition free. But if students fail to meet the terms of the contract, Temple won’t pay for any additional time in school.
For the first Temple students who signed the contract, in 2014, 61.6% are on track to graduate on time in 2018. For those who declined, 46.5% are on track, school officials say.
Data analytics Another tool being used to keep students on track: data analytics. At Georgia State University, in Atlanta, about 100 full-time advisers receive electronic alerts when students enroll in the wrong course, a course out of sequence or receive a bad grade. The advisers must then reach out to students within 48 hours.
“We are trying to approximate elite institutions that notice and redirect students when they make a bad choice,” says Timothy Renick, vice provost at Georgia State, where 80% of students work full or part time.

The school’s four-year graduation rate has doubled to 29% over five years. Moreover, the average bachelor’s degree student is graduating with eight fewer credit hours than five years ago, translating into about $15 million in savings for this year’s graduating class, Mr. Renick says.
The University of Texas in Austin has used data from academic transcripts and personal records to identify the 25% of students least likely to graduate on time. Those most at risk are put in the University Leadership Network, which pays students $5,000 each year if they earn 25% of their degree requirements and maintain a 2.0 grade-point average, school officials say. Students also are required to attend weekly seminars and do internships on campus.
David Laude, senior vice provost at the University of Texas, says the school’s four-year graduation rate rose to 61% in 2016 from 50% in 2011. The goal for this year’s graduating class was 70%, he says, but the school doesn’t know yet if it met that goal.
“It creates a network on campus,” he says. “So when students have a problem, they seek out someone at UT rather than taking a bus home.”

But his plan still leaves a lot to be desired. Bill Pugliano/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Bill Pugliano/Getty Images President Trump delivers a speech Wednesday in Cincinnati on transportation and infrastructure projects. But his plan still leaves a lot to be desired. Bill Pugliano/Getty Images 
Despite America's rapt attention on former FBI Director James Comey's testimony , the White House has been observing Infrastructure Week. Infrastructure is one of the only policy areas that could have crossover appeal, but there has been little real movement so far on getting something through Congress. 
To kick off the festivities, the president on Monday pushed his plan to privatize air-traffic control. And on Wednesday, he touted his broader infrastructure spending plan. The basic idea of this plan is that the government will spend $200 billion, using tax breaks to incentivize private business to, in turn, spend more money on infrastructure projects. Altogether, with state and local contributions as well, spending would total $1 trillion. The administration also said that it would cut regulations to help the government ""get out of the way"" of building projects. Trump Is Worried About The Trade Deficit With Germany. He Needn't Be 
Those are the basic outlines of the infrastructure proposal that the administration has been talking about throughout Trump's first four months in office. However, there's still not a detailed plan, nothing has been introduced in Congress and answers to some big questions remain elusive. 
The administration will have to figure out those details before it formally introduces its plan (and isn't simply touting it to attempt a diversion from the Comey testimony). Here are a few more of the questions the administration will have to ask itself — and, perhaps, transportation policy wonks — if the White House is hoping to implement the plan. 
1. Where are the details? 
Trump's speech in Cincinnati on Wednesday and a subsequent press release contained little new information on how his plan would work. The administration had said ahead of time that it would be announcing new spending on rural infrastructure, for example. That kind of spending might calm the fears of some rural residents, after Trump's initial budget proposed slashing rural development and transportation spending. 
But in a Wednesday press release on the plan, the only details were: 
""Rural America will receive grants to rebuild crippled bridges, roads, and waterways."" 
A White House spokesperson told NPR via email on Wednesday that there are no further details on that spending. Trump's Approval Rating Decline Isn't That Big Compared With Predecessors' Drops 
And while the plan released Wednesday also said the government would spend $200 billion, it didn't say how that spending would break down — how much would be for tax credits, and how much would be for grants, for example. The White House spokesperson likewise said those details are not available. 
One other question, says one expert, is what the specifics of these partnerships between the government and the private businesses will look like. 
""The idea that you can spur a larger amount of infrastructure funding than the federal dollars is not, in and of itself, unique,"" said Jacob Leibenluft, a senior adviser at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning fiscal policy think tank. ""But it's pretty important to explain how you do it."" 
2. How many jobs could it really create? 
Trump promotes jobs as a big selling point of his infrastructure plan. But given current economic conditions, the job creation could be underwhelming. GOP Health Plan Would Leave 23 Million More Uninsured, Budget Office Says 
""The administration talks jobs, jobs, jobs, but I think most economists would recognize that we have the unemployment rate quite low,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the right-leaning American Action Forum and a former head of the Congressional Budget Office. ""The number of new jobs that would be created is limited."" 
There could be some economic boosts, Holtz-Eakin added, but it might not show up in those headline jobs numbers. Rather, he said, there are other potential benefits. 
""It would be a productivity improvement, and that will show up in higher wages more than in higher jobs,"" Holtz-Eakin predicted. 
There are also certainly other benefits of infrastructure projects — smooth roads and non-crumbling bridges, for example — but as jobs are a big selling point here, it's worth asking how big the effect would actually be. 
One related question is about the nature of the projects the tax credits might spur. They are designed to incentivize building, but it's possible, Leibenluft warned, that builders would take the credits on projects they would have done anyway. ""Your hope would be that they're only supporting projects that wouldn't happen otherwise,"" he said. 
3. Could the plan be undercut by other federal infrastructure spending cuts? 
In the president's budget proposal, the $200 billion would be spent over the next 10 years. But other infrastructure spending would take a hit over the next decade, Leibenluft pointed out in a blog post this week. 
The president's budget would cut Amtrak spending, for example, and it would ensure that the Highway Trust Fund doesn't dole out any more than it takes in in revenue. The fund has some major fiscal problems, and a 2015 CBO report showed a shortfall projected to grow in the coming decade. Part of the funding issue is that gas tax revenues have fallen off. (The gas tax pays for the fund.) But how to fix the fund's shortfalls is a topic for a different article. 
All of which is to say: the Trump administration's budget focuses heavily on cutting spending. But whatever infrastructure spending is cut means the trillion-dollar plan could have that much more ground to make up, both in terms of projects and economic gains. 
4. Will state and local governments be able to afford it? 
Infrastructure spending comes from a mix of federal, state and local sources. In fact, only around a quarter of total spending on transit and highways comes from the federal government, according to a May 2014 report from the Pew Charitable Trusts. 
The question then is to what degree this plan could leave state and local governments to pony up more money. Earlier information from the White House on its infrastructure proposal said the plan would ""support more communities moving toward a model of independence,"" arguing that local officials know necessary infrastructure programs better than the federal government. 
Some state and local officials have balked at this idea of ""self-help,"" as Bloomberg reported earlier this year, saying that they may not be able to afford the kind of investment their infrastructure needs. 
""Our citizens think they're overtaxed today,"" said Oklahoma City Republican Mayor Mick Kornett , as reported by Bloomberg. ""If the idea is that we're going to somehow pass initiatives with funding to keep up the roads and the bridges and all of the infrastructure that's out there, that seems like a tough sell to me.""",Trump's Infrastructure Plan Still Could Use More Planning : NPR,normal,fc961a0a950dca62e67e99e6efef5b5312a02e97

DP World in a brief statement Thursday said the acquisition of Reyser allows the company to consolidate its market position in Spain and secure entry into new geographies. It didn’t announce a value for the deal, which is estimated to be around $150 million.
The acquisition is “part of our broader strategy to grow complementary sectors in the global supply chain such as industrial parks, free-zones and logistics supported by new technologies,” said Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, group chairman and chief executive at DP World.
Reyser, whose services include harbor towage, mooring, bunkering and diving, has long term agreements in 10 ports in Spain and contracts with two international liquefied natural gas terminals at Saint John, New Brunswick in Canada and Point Fortin in Trinidad and Tobago, according to the DP World statement.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: 
Britain's prime minister, Theresa May, woke up this morning and had a duty to perform. Though her party suffered disaster in yesterday's elections and lost its majority in Parliament, the Conservatives still have the most seats.
So Theresa May went across London to Buckingham Palace and asked Queen Elizabeth for permission to form a government. Then she got in the car, returned to her residence, 10 Downing St., and spoke briefly to the press on the way in.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY: What the country needs more than ever is certainty. And having secured the largest number of votes and the greatest number of seats in the general election, it is clear that only the Conservative and Unionist Party has the legitimacy and ability to provide that certainty by commanding a majority in the House of Commons.
INSKEEP: Then she walked inside number 10, door closed. NPR's Frank Langfitt is somewhere outside and trying to make sense of all this. Hi, Frank.
FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hi, Steve.
INSKEEP: So a very calm statement there, nothing to see here, we win.
LANGFITT: Yeah. It's sort of - I don't want to be disrespectful to the prime minister of the United Kingdom, but it seemed like nothing happened yesterday. It would be like the equivalent of coming home and finding that your house had burned down or something and your spouse saying no, everything's fine.
It's sort of an extraordinary event yesterday, and yet, she comes out today as though nothing has happened. And this comes when there's just tremendous turmoil politically on the U.K. landscape.
INSKEEP: Yeah. I'm just thinking - there was a time when President Bush's party in the United States lost its majority in Congress. He said, we took a thumping. President Obama's party lost the Senate, we took a shellacking he said - or maybe it was the House. In any case, you have to acknowledge that you got defeated, even if you're still in office. Nothing there from May.
LANGFITT: Yeah. It's a - it is a very - it was a very strange thing to watch as though nothing had happened. And I think what she's trying to do is obviously hold on to control of power here. Obviously she wants to have a government going forward, but there's no acknowledgment of what - yesterday was just a colossal disaster and a surprise when you consider that she - when she called for snap elections back in April, she looked like she was headed towards a landslide.
She actually lost seats yesterday. So it's one of the biggest miscalculations in a long time by a prime minister, the last being the Brexit vote decision by David Cameron.
INSKEEP: And now she's in the middle of trying to negotiate Brexit, will have to do it with a far-weakened Conservative Party. A few quick questions here. She doesn't have a majority. She has to have a majority. It's majority rule. How does she get one?
LANGFITT: She's reached out to the Democratic Unionist Party in Northern Ireland. And they're a very small party, but they seem to be willing to work with her. They are pro-Brexit. They are skeptical of the European Union, so perhaps this is a good match. But, of course, she's going to have negotiations - Brexit negotiations - beginning later this month.
And, you know, she's not going to be seen as strong at all in Europe. She had been talking really tough with them. She just got clobbered to a great extent by Jeremy Corbyn and his Labour Party, so she comes into this in a much more weakened state.
INSKEEP: Well, you said she wants to hold on to power - will she? Does she keep her job?
LANGFITT: I think for the time being. And I think we sort of need to watch this day by day. For the time being, it looks like she will. But people that I've been talking to both in the streets and also people who are political analysts thinks - think that this is a very bad wound.
And trying to hold onto a coalition like this may be very difficult, so she may not be able to. The question is, how long can she make it? Some people think maybe by sometime in the fall, she will no longer be prime minister.
INSKEEP: Brexit negotiations will go ahead?
LANGFITT: They will go ahead, and I think the U.K. is going to leave the European Union, but exactly what the terms of that are unclear because the vote that the Labour Party got here suggested that people may not want the kind of sharp Brexit that she wants to really sever relations with the European Union, a lot of uneasiness.
INSKEEP: OK. Thanks very much. That's NPR's Frank Langfitt in London.

They never know how much they're going to make. To reach a goal, some drivers stay on the job at least 14 hours — sometimes longer.
DAVID GREENE, HOST: 
You know, there's an unusual thing about driving for Uber. Your pay is constantly changing. It's dynamic. The company dials the fare up and down according to supply and demand. Economists, of course, marvel at this superpower. Setting price in real time is something you couldn't do before the smartphone.
Drivers, though, scratch their heads because they're just not sure what they're making. As NPR's Aarti Shahani discovered, it can lead some drivers to stay on the road many more hours than is actually safe.
AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: NPR surveyed hundreds of Uber drivers. Seventy-nine of them say that, to hit an earnings goal or finish a far-out-of-the-way ride, they've driven shifts 14 hours or longer. That means being in the car, Uber app on, either driving a passenger or waiting for work.
Three people showed NPR documentation for driving about 20 hours in one day. Uber places no limit on how long you can drive. This is clearly a public safety hazard. But Uber drivers talk about it like it's normal.
KYLE RENINGER: Well, I'm getting started a little late here.
SHAHANI: It's Friday, 5:06 p.m., time for Kyle Reninger to cash in as an Uber driver. He thinks he can make $200 tonight.
RENINGER: So I chose to take a nap in the middle of the day so that I could stay up later tonight and drive.
SHAHANI: The 32-year-old from Muncie, Ind., is keeping an audio diary for NPR over several weeks so we can peer into his modern workplace. He holds his phone or uses speaker phone depending on if he's driving or not, so you'll hear the difference.
Reninger drives weekend nights because he finds that's when you're most likely to pick up surge fares, the higher prices - two, three, five times the regular rate that passengers hate to pay and that drivers live by, the nuggets of the Uber gold rush. Reninger started a Facebook group for Muncie drivers to share advice, tricks. He says people have to enjoy this job.
RENINGER: If you don't enjoy doing it, then what's the point, really? You know, it's complete contractor-based work.
SHAHANI: Reninger feels like his own boss, and Uber is his side gig. He and his wife have a family business selling vegan baked goods. So he loads his car with vegan cookies and gets to market a bit to his passengers. He's on Uber and Lyft, a competitor, though the vast majority of his business comes from Uber.
RENINGER: I got my first request for the night. It took a little over an hour to get my first request - so not too bad.
SHAHANI: That's one hour driving around with his app on. The best drivers have a lay of the land and a strategy. Tonight, Reninger notices on his Facebook group that a lot of other drivers are staying local. So he decides to head south, a little more than an hour away, to Indianapolis. He says his first passenger, Diane (ph), was a nice lady. But...
RENINGER: The bad part of it was that I checked how much the estimated trip would've cost. And Uber says 25. And my driver app says that she was charged 18. So there's a obvious discrepancy there.
SHAHANI: Minus the Uber fee, he makes $14.14, which is not great after one hour and 38 minutes on the road. Reninger says he's used to Uber playing this game, estimating one fare and paying another. He sends Uber a message, basically saying, hey, I got underpaid $7 here. Fix that. Then he keeps on waiting for his next passenger.
RENINGER: This is the hard part, the in-between. Not really sure, you know, if I should drive around and hope to get another ping or if I should head back north.
SHAHANI: And in between the waiting, the passengers he manages to get make him laugh, think, cringe - 9:30 p.m.
RENINGER: Good conversation with the last rider - interesting. He's a world traveler, just got back from Amsterdam.
SHAHANI: 11:45 p.m.
RENINGER: Then you have the one jerk for the night.
SHAHANI: Drunk guy with an open beer in his hand. Reninger says, you can't bring it in.
RENINGER: Said, sorry, man. It's the law. He's like, whatever.
SHAHANI: Drunk guy motions like he's setting the can down in the street. But it turns out he didn't.
RENINGER: So that was kind of a jerk move.
SHAHANI: 1:42 a.m.
RENINGER: About halfway through the night, I guess - or more than half way - and only about halfway to my goal, though.
SHAHANI: Again, he was hoping for $200. 2:43 a.m. - another drunk guy.
RENINGER: He asked me my name about 12 times. And he kept saying, that's a great name. That's a great name. And I'm really drunk, man. I'm really drunk.
SHAHANI: And it didn't end there. Reninger took him to IHOP.
RENINGER: I dropped him off there - got out of the car, zipped down his pants and started to urinate right in front of IHOP and then just walked in like nothing happened.
SHAHANI: 3:36 a.m. - his first surge fare for the night.
RENINGER: And it was only a 1.8-point surge. But even that makes such a huge difference.
SHAHANI: 6:11 a.m. - an airport run - actually when he coordinated with his first passenger, that nice lady Diane.
RENINGER: And she tipped me ten bucks cash, which was nice of her.
SHAHANI: Uber, by the way, rejected his claim in the $7 dispute. You can start to hear Kyle Reninger's voice fading. And there's something he's not admitting right now. He waits until he gets home to mention he was having a hard time behind the wheel.
RENINGER: Just listen to more comedy and roll the window down. Sip on water. Just try to stay awake. I made it, though. And I'm going to go crash for a while.
SHAHANI: All told, Kyle Reninger was in his car 14 hours, nine minutes. He covered a total of 401.2 miles. If you put aside the cost of gas, he made $165.30. Plus tips, he nearly hit his goal of $200. It just took a couple more hours than he'd hoped, but it was by no means his longest shift.
And so it goes. Each night is a gamble. The hours go by just like in a casino. Only here, hooked by ambition and uncertainty, you could get tired and kill someone. One final note - Uber could design its app to lock out drivers after a certain number of hours, but a company spokesperson says in an e-mail, Uber is a flexible work opportunity.
Also, the company is testing out a new app alert to remind drivers about the importance of getting enough rest. Aarti Shahani, NPR News, San Francisco.

Comey spoke publicly about what he had previously leaked to media regarding President Trump's efforts to influence the probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and ties to Russia. 
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: 
The testimony of former FBI Director James Comey offered a glimpse yesterday into how Washington works. Comey, worried about obstruction of justice, about the story not getting out - so he leaked information. Republican Senator Roy Blunt asked Comey about this yesterday. 
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) 
ROY BLUNT: On the Flynn issue, specifically, I believe you said earlier that you believed the president was suggesting you drop any investigation of Flynn's account of his conversation with the Russian ambassador, which was essentially misleading the vice president and others? 
JAMES COMEY: Correct. 
BLUNT: You said after you were dismissed, you gave information to a friend so that friend could get that information into the public media. 
COMEY: Correct. 
INSKEEP: So much in that word correct. And let's talk it through with NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis, who's in our studios. Good morning, Susan. 
SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. 
INSKEEP: OK, he's talking about Michael Flynn, the national security adviser and this request by President Trump that he drop the Flynn investigation. And then he says trying to get the information to the public media. What's going on there? 
DAVIS: Well, you know, what Comey said and from his perspective is that the actions that President Trump took is that Comey, from his view, felt unique pressure to let it go, in the words of the president that he recalled in his now-famous memos. 
INSKEEP: Yeah. 
DAVIS: And that he saw that as an attempt to influence his decision-making at the FBI. 
INSKEEP: And he thought, whoever replaces me as FBI director is not going to be allowed to pursue this investigation either. 
DAVIS: Right. 
INSKEEP: And so he did what? 
DAVIS: And so he started to - he took these memos, which he kept detailed accounts of all of his interactions with the president. And in one of these memos, after he was fired, he gave it to a friend of his, a law professor, who leaked it to The New York Times with Comey's consent. And Comey did that with the intention of forcing the hand of the deputy attorney general to appoint a special counsel. 
And it worked. That special counsel is now Robert Mueller. 
INSKEEP: And there you go. Now, the essential question here is was the president ordering or pressuring Comey by saying I hope you can see your way to letting Flynn go, or was he just talking? And Republican Senator Jim Risch asked Comey about that. Let's listen. 
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) 
JAMES RISCH: He said, I hope. Do you know of any case where a person has been charged for obstruction of justice, or for that matter, any other criminal offense where they said or thought they hoped for an outcome? 
COMEY: I don't know well enough to answer. And the reason I keep saying his words is I took it as a direction. 
INSKEEP: Why did he take it as a direction if Trump was just saying, I hope you can do this? 
DAVIS: Well, this is like a political ""Rashomon,"" right? Only two men were in a room. One conversation happened, and they both walked out with two distinct impressions of what that was. We should note that the president's lawyer says that his impression was never to pressure the FBI director. And his lawyer gave a robust defense of the president and said this didn't happen... 
INSKEEP: Although he did ask everybody to leave the room. And he is the president of the United States talking to a subordinate. Is that why Comey would take this as a direction? 
DAVIS: Well, that is how Comey interpreted it. But we should also note that Republicans say that this is maybe just one more mark of an unconventional president. 
INSKEEP: OK. So much more to discuss. NPR's Susan Davis, thanks very much.

In a single-industry town 200 miles north of Moscow, the population and job opportunities are dwindling.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: 
And now let's go to David Greene, who's coming to us live from Moscow this morning. Hello again, David.
DAVID GREENE, HOST: 
Hey there, Steve. Yeah, we're here trying to understand this country that has been in the news in the United States so much and understand Vladimir Putin's Russia at a moment when his country is just on so many minds back home. We were here in NPR's bureau last night after a long day at work. We were getting ready for the show this morning. And our correspondent who's based here, Lucian Kim, he had just walked in from a reporting trip.
LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Yeah, so I went out to this town that's called Kuvshinova. It's about 200 miles north of Moscow. It's a so-called monotown. And there are more than 300 of them in Russia. Basically they're company towns built around a single industry. And many are suffering from the transition from communism to capitalism. Kuvshinova has one of the oldest paper factories in Russia. What's interesting is that the new machinery that they bought allows them to increase productivity and they've laid off hundreds of people, so today that town has less than 10,000 people. It's lost a quarter of its population since the fall of the Soviet Union.
GREENE: I mean, what is life like there? What do people tell you who live there?
KIM: Well, first of all, it's not very easy to be an American journalist in a Russian backwater.
GREENE: Oh, really?
KIM: People are very friendly, but they're also very cautious and very suspicious. I did have a taxi driver, he didn't have any complexes. He complained about the lack of work and just, you know, lack - a general lack of opportunities, especially for young people. He had a son. I rolled with that. I said, OK, well, maybe Western sanctions are to blame for that (laughter). He just laughed and said that's completely irrelevant.
But probably the most impressive man I spoke to, his name is Ivan Paramonov (ph). He's 85 years old. And he was the Communist Party boss in the factory. It was amazing listening to him talk. He was so proud of the honors that his factory won. And now he says there's absolutely nothing to be proud of. He says the government talks about higher pensions and salaries. He says he doesn't know anybody who's experienced that.
IVAN PARAMONOV: (Speaking Russian).
KIM: He's saying, how can you put up with 10 percent of the country owning all of the natural resources in Russia? So for him, you know, it was all about social injustice, but also, interestingly enough, about kind of the geographic imbalance in Russia. He said we should stop just focusing on Moscow and St. Petersburg and remember that there are towns like his and also just all the rural areas, all the agricultural areas of Russia.
GREENE: So does that capture the feeling you were getting from the entire population there, a feeling of resentment about, you know, cities like Moscow, St. Petersburg and a lot of anger? Is that what you were feeling?
KIM: Definitely. But it was actually - I had a completely new feeling when I was there. I mean, I've been coming to Russia since the early 1990s, but they all kind of jelled in this one town because it's there that I felt this really strange mixture of pride and shame at the same time. Pride in the sense that the people there were proud that they're Russians and that they built a great country, especially the Soviet Union that had achieved a certain measure of equality. And at the same time, they were a bit ashamed because the difficulty of their situation, living in that rather decrepit town, was obvious. It was plain to see for anybody.
GREENE: You're saying it's the first time you sort of put that together, that strange sort of mix of emotions. But what does that say about Russia, do you think, right now in 2017?
KIM: Well, as I said, I mean, it was really a moment of truth for me. And I think it also explains a lot of the government's - the Russian government's actions that we're seeing in the world. On the one hand, there's this feeling that Russia is entitled to be a great power, it is a great power. And at the same time, there's this realization that there are also a lot of very big unresolved problems at home.
GREENE: All right, Lucian Kim. He's a Moscow correspondent for NPR. And we've invaded his office this week as we're hosting...

Thursday is set to be a bumper day for political news, with former FBI Director James Comey facing the Senate Intelligence Committee and the U.K. heading to the polls for its general election. Speaking of votes, while only one-fifth of WPP shareholders voted against Chief Executive Martin Sorrell’s pay at the annual meeting yesterday, lots of questions were asked about the advertising group’s plans for when (if!) he retires.
“Hey Siri. Factory reset” Former Apple employees say Siri has been held back by a lack of ambition and usage data , allowing Amazon and Google to pull ahead in the voice race, The Wall Street Journal reports. Constellation Research principal analyst Holger Mueller summed up Apple’s Siri woes succinctly: “Siri is a textbook of leading on something in tech and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley.” Some developers have grown tired of Siri’s unreliability and moved on to developing for Google Home and Alexa instead. Data-driven voice assistants are the newest medium marketers are looking to get their heads around, but if Siri (which powers Apple’s new HomePod) is not front of mind for developers, it’ll fall down the priority list for CMOs too.
Synergies Recode’s Kara Swisher is reporting that there will be “up to 1,000” layoffs once Yahoo and AOL merge to form a unit of Verizon called Oath. TechCrunch, which is owned by AOL, said the merger could lead to as many as 2,100 job cuts ( 15% of the combined global workforce of AOL and Yahoo). An AOL spokesman sent me this statement: “Oath’s strategy is to lead the global brand space. With access to over 1 billion consumers upon close, we will be positioned to drive one of the most important platforms in the consumer brand space. Consistent with what we have said since the deal was announced, we will be aligning our global organization to the strategy.”
—What Comes Next—
Verizon’s acquisition of Yahoo is expected to close “in the next week,” according to Recode’s report, so Tim Armstrong can finally get started on his mission to grow Oath’s audience to 2 billion and its revenue up to $20 billion by 2020. Mr. Armstrong told me last month Oath has plans to launch “a series of new products” by the end of the year “that are tuned up for mobile and video,” so it’ll be interesting to see what other new brands he’s had up his sleeve all this time.
Swipe Right and Super Like Delta and Wieden + Kennedy New York created a smart out-of-home activation , sticking up scenes of famous global locations on a wall for Brooklyn’s singles to take selfies against and upload to Tinder so they appear well-traveled to potential dates, Adweek reports. Yes, if you’ve ever been on a delayed Delta red-eye, you’ll probably think the marketing budget would have been better allocated elsewhere, but this campaign is funny, a little bit cynical and it’s guaranteed to get more interaction than your average billboard. Delta is also working with Vice to launch a series of hip public events, another sign the airline is setting its sights on young fliers.
Just Boo-Boo It Another excellent example of creativity from Wieden + Kennedy for you, this time out of Shanghai: The agency worked with Nike to create bandages for kids that double up as comic strips , helping to take their minds off their injuries (and calm the concerns of protective parents). As Fast Company reports, the comics make heroes of athletes who fell down but got back up again to triumph. Nike will give out the bandages for free with purchases from its “Young Athletes” line. The idea of bandages festooned with cartoons is nothing new—Band-Aid has had that market wrapped up for years—but it’s a smart marketing tactic to encourage doting parents to think of Nike when buying their kids’ sporting gear.

AP Ordinary people often get into legal trouble in response to desperate circumstances. Politicians, however, seem to make the worst trouble for themselves when they are riding high and carrying all before them.
Thus the most famous political scandals of U.S. history have happened not when presidents or members of Congress had their backs to the wall but when their sails were filled with a favorable wind.
In earlier generations we have seen presidents from Warren Harding in the 1920s to Richard Nixon in the 1970s, Ronald Reagan in the 1980s and Bill Clinton in the 1990s beset by scandal, all at the apex of their political clout and acclaim.
President Warren G. Harding delivers an address in St. Louis in 1918. AP hide caption

National Security Comey Opening Statement For Senate Intelligence Hearing, Annotated We are reminded of this now because echoes of the past have been audible in the testimony of former FBI Director James Comey before the Senate Intelligence Committee this week.
Comey sketched the scope of the alleged Russian effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election in the U.S.
He also said he had been fired by President Trump over his handling of the FBI investigation of that interference and connections to the Russians among Trump's inner circle.
Politics Comey Accuses White House Of 'Lies, Plain And Simple' About His Firing With the appointment of Comey's FBI predecessor, Robert Mueller, as a special counsel to investigate the Russian interference and its relation to Trump World, we are entering a new phase of this story. Remarkably, it appears the Trump White House continues to regard it all as political badinage more than an actual legal exposure with enormous implications.
And in that sense, they share an attitude with other administrations that have suffered from a myopia about their own vulnerability – and suffered for it as well.

Drew Angerer/Getty Images The stage is set 
Late last year, having won a presidential election few expected them to win, Trump and Company had the political world at their feet. Republicans as divergent as Mitt Romney and Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Paul Ryan were willing to forget their past rivalry, criticism and opposition to be part of a new future — in service to the new leader of the party and the nation.

toggle caption Eric Thayer/Getty Images President Trump attends an Infrastructure Summit with U.S. governors and mayors in the White House on Thursday, the same day fired FBI Director James Comey testified on Capitol Hill.
Eric Thayer/Getty Images But in this sunburst of success, the transition team around the president-elect seems to have been blind to what was looming on the horizon, a threat born of the campaign's own relationships with elements of the Russian government.
In his testimony this week, Comey spoke of cyber-attacks on ""perhaps more than a thousand"" different entities and agencies in and out of government. He called it an effort to tell Americans ""what to think and what to fight about,"" and ""a big deal.""
But the response of the president-elect and his entourage has been all along to cast doubt on the existence of the attacks, doubt on the Russian role and doubt on the motives of those who, like Comey, saw something nefarious afoot. It was, said the president, all an excuse for the disappointing showing by the Democrats at the ballot box, a line he has repeated even into the spring.
Politics There Are Many Russia Investigations. What Are They All Doing? Mueller is now beginning his investigation with a heavy-weight staff and a meaningful mandate. Committees in Congress will also continue taking testimony. Much of all this will take place in private. Time will pass before we know the full extent of their findings.
But this much is clear. Something the Trump team might have dealt with expeditiously as recently as six months ago has grown to cast a shadow on the White House and the prospects for the president's agenda.
In that sense, the early stumbles of the new administration remind us of previous rough patches for predecessors. Other administrations also missed the chance to cut their losses at the first sign of scandal, and they did so in part because trouble struck when they were at a moment of maximum power and expectation.
On Thursday, Speaker Paul Ryan said President Trump's only problem was ""he's new at this."" Trump, 70, has been called many things over the years, but rarely ""naïve."" It is more likely the president-elect of late 2016 and early 2017 considered himself to be bullet-proof.
Lessons to be learned 
What we have seen in the past is that the Oval Office can quickly become a low-altitude version of Olympus from which policy decisions and appointments are handed down. This attitude takes hold during the first transition into office and often reaches an apogee after re-election. (If that is true, it is a challenge to imagine what a second Trump transition period might look like.)
In the hubris of the moment, having vanquished the world of electoral politics, a new or re-elected administration is fully confident of its mandate, and equally full of itself. In such a moment, when that first bad story comes down the pike, the first impulse in the White House is to will it away or eradicate it by any means necessary.
And in their resolve to rid themselves of the problem in this way, they make mistakes that less cocksure people would be less likely to make. To wit: denying the story or the problem even exists, moving to quash all evidence to the contrary and to remove all those who disagree (and, as a rule, to denounce the media).
What may begin as a relatively minor matter of limited and temporal consequence morphs into a disaster. Underlings and intermediaries lose their jobs and sometimes go to jail. And once in a while, the destruction even reaches the top of the pyramid.
The paramount example is, of course, Watergate, which ultimately forced Nixon to resign. It began even as Nixon was sweeping to a 49-state landslide re-election in 1972. When the burglars were arrested at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, the question for those who sent them became whether to pay hush money. Then the sources of the money had to be hidden, and so on.
Lies were piled upon lies. It all led back to the president himself, and there turned out to be incriminating conversations preserved on tape. In the end, Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment.
After their own re-elections, Reagan and Clinton both saw their second terms in office nearly derailed by scandals that could have been smothered far sooner with a bit of foresight and the proper resolve.

toggle caption National Archives President Ronald Reagan meets with the Tower Commission, which investigated the Iran-Contra scandal. The three-member commission, chaired by former Senator John Tower, a Republican, was harshly critical of the White House staff.
National Archives In Reagan's case it was an effort to free hostages held by a terrorist group in Lebanon by selling arms to their allies in Iran and then using the proceeds to finance anti-communist insurgents in Central America.
Known as the Iran-Contra scandal, it was rather legalistic and devolved to a partisan hearing on Capitol Hill that allowed for dramatic defenses by some of the accused. The public was interested, some were exercised, but Reagan himself was well-insulated. No one went to jail but one fellow was caught in the backwash and found to have evaded some taxes.
The public was also rather ambivalent about the main scandal of the Clinton years, his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and subsequent perjury in denying it.

toggle caption Doug Mills/AP President Bill Clinton get applause from Vice President Gore as first lady Hillary Clinton looks on outside the Oval Office after the House of Representatives voted to impeach the president on Dec. 19, 1998.
Doug Mills/AP The affair came to light after Clinton's surprisingly easy re-election. Clinton had been unwilling to settle a sexual harrassment lawsuit in the mid-1990s filed by an Arkansas woman named Paula Jones and that suit became the platform on which Lewinsky was introduced to the nation.
The result was impeachment and a grinding, debilitating trial in the Senate, which failed to result in even a majority for conviction, let alone the required two-thirds.
The illusion of invincibility blinded these presidents and their inner circles in the critical moments when an infection was becoming a systemic threat to life. In those moments, they reacted with arrogance to what they saw as an embarrassment or a distraction with political implications. They made a fire in a garage into a five-alarm catastrophe that shattered careers, sent officials to jail and turned the trajectory of a presidency to the worse.

The worst may be over for the marine shipping industry, after years of overcapacity and devastating price wars. An improving global economy is driving more oceanbound trade , with volumes in the dry-bulk sector expected to grow 3%, outpacing a projected 1% increase in capacity. Improved demand from China for thermal coal and iron ore are helping drive up demand for dry-bulk ships. The container market is also rebounding, with prices up 55% last month. Container shipping lines have greater control over capacity and rates on key routes after the biggest players consolidated into a handful of alliances, the WSJ’s Costas Paris writes. Collectively, these operators are likely to turn a profit this year, after multi-billion-dollar losses in 2016. Oil tankers have had a rougher start to the year, but with more older ships headed for the scrapyard, buyers have snapped up 69 new and used very large crude carriers this year through May, compared with just eight last year.
President Donald Trump’s infrastructure spending plan conjures up images of repairs to crumbling bridges and potholed highways. But farmers are hoping there’s a little left over to fix aging inland waterways , the systems of locks and dams vital to the movement of crops from the heartland to the coasts, the WSJ’s Jacob Bunge and Jesse Newman write. The U.S. river system ferries nearly three-quarters of export-bound U.S. grain to ocean ports, but most locks and dams, which allow river barges to move through various elevations, have outlived their intended 50-year lifespans. U.S. exporters absorb some of the financial toll of inefficient transport, with farmers on the Upper Mississippi or Illinois rivers receiving up to 21 cents less per bushel of corn in the event of unplanned closings of certain locks. Such closings could leave grain companies with less supply to bring to market and reduce economic activity by up to $2.4 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Reliability concerns could also make U.S. farmers less competitive globally, as other farm powers like Brazil work to cut their transportation costs. Repairs won’t be cheap: trade groups estimate that high priority repairs could total $8.7 billion.
Chinese smartphone makers are making a name for themselves in developing markets where brands like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. have failed to adapt. For example, Chinese manufacturer Transsion Holdings Ltd. became the top player in Africa by developing localized features like devices with two card slots for customers who had multiple SIM cards, and an optimized camera for people with dark skin. Oppo rolled out wide angle front facing cameras when it noticed its South Asian customers liked taking group selfies. These companies and others are clustered in China’s Pearl River Delta, close to component makers that have graduated from contract manufacturers for Western technology companies to innovators in their own right. Cheap production costs and access to the latest advances have sparked fierce competition between Chinese smartphone makers, which now pose a threat to global giants. Oppo sell more than three phones in China for every two sold by Apple. Chinese makers are also making strides in the U.S. Smartphone makers from China increased their market share to 19% in the U.S. last year from 13% in 2012, at the expense of Apple and Taiwanese maker HTC Corp. But fierce brand loyalty among Apple customers means the different Chinese players are mostly competing against themselves.

Bebe Stores Inc. is selling some of the last vestiges of its brick-and-mortar past in order to guarantee a future online. The company announced a series of deals, including the sale of its distribution center , aimed at keeping the women’s fashion retailer out of bankruptcy, avoiding a fate that’s ensnared many of its peers this year. Like other brick-and-mortar retailers, Bebe has been pressured by falling mall traffic as more shoppers move online. Bebe has set itself apart from retailers like Limited Stores Co. and the Wet Seal Inc. by finding a way to avoid Chapter 11 protection and cutting deals with its landlords, WSJ’s Lillian Rizzo writes. Bebe will sell its 72,000-square-foot distribution center in California to Tulloch Corp. in a $21.8 million and pay its way out of store leases for $65 million. The brand and website will continue to live on for now through a joint venture agreement with Bluestar Alliance LLC signed last year. Eventually Bebe plans to transfer its domain name and international wholesale agreements to Bluestar.

France's president accused the English-language news channel RT — which is funded by the Russian government — of ""deceitful propaganda."" David Greene talks to RT Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan. 
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: 
The investigation of Russian interference took our colleague David Greene to Moscow, and he's on the line. Who are you talking to, David? 
DAVID GREENE, HOST: 
Well, Steve, one person I want to introduce you to is Margarita Simonyan. She is the editor-in-chief at RT. That's the English-language news channel that is of course funded by the Russian government... 
INSKEEP: Yeah. 
GREENE: ...And seen by many as just a propaganda machine. The latest criticism of RT came from French President Emmanuel Macron. He said RT engaged in what he called deceitful propaganda to support his election opponent, the far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Now, Margarita Simonyan - she said she's thinking of suing Macron for slandering her network. And she said RT was just trying to counter what she calls the mainstream media. 
MARGARITA SIMONYAN: All of the mainstream French media - all of them - were jumping out of their pants to make people vote for Macron - all of them. I can... 
GREENE: Well - and that's my question. Did you... 
SIMONYAN: ...Give you tons of examples. 
GREENE: But did that make it RT's role... 
SIMONYAN: But still, we are propaganda, and they're not. 
GREENE: So this really speaks to how Simonyan sees RT's role. She says the mainstream media has its own narrative about Russia that she needs to combat. And some say she is basically just taking orders directly from the Kremlin. 
Let me ask you about another issue that comes up frequently among your critics - that you have some sort of telephone in this office where you have a direct link to someone who works for Vladimir Putin and you have editorial discussions on that phone. 
SIMONYAN: I... 
GREENE: Does that phone exist? Is it somewhere in this office? Is it... 
SIMONYAN: Yeah, I have a phone. It's right here, which I use whenever I have to discuss something that is needed what is called secure line. 
GREENE: There's this narrative line that this is a secure line to the Kremlin. 
SIMONYAN: Just today, I talked on that line with the Russian central bank discussing some of the issues of RT finances that probably shouldn't be discussed on an open line. So... 
GREENE: Do you talk to people who work for Vladimir Putin on that line? 
SIMONYAN: See, (laughter) you don't want to listen to the answer, do you? You don't... 
GREENE: I do. 
SIMONYAN: ...Want to hear the answer. 
GREENE: I want to hear the answer. 
SIMONYAN: No, you don't. You want a statement that you can using use in your broadcast. I'm a journalist as well. All of the people who work in the Russian government and Russian presidential administration, in this way or another, work for Vladimir Putin. I talk to all sorts of people. Many times... 
GREENE: Well, let me ask the question in a more fair way. Do you ever make editorial decisions... 
SIMONYAN: We... 
GREENE: ...About the mission of RT and story decisions with people who are working very closely with Vladimir Putin? 
SIMONYAN: We never make editorial decisions with people who are working closely with Vladimir Putin, unless you consider myself a person who is working closely with Vladimir Putin. That, a lot of people actually would say so. 
GREENE: Would you say so? 
SIMONYAN: I wouldn't. 
GREENE: Do you have a relationship with him? I mean, are you friends? Are you... 
SIMONYAN: (Laughter) No, we're not friends. I know him. I've known him ever since I was 20 or 21 because I - just like you have White House pool, we have the Kremlin pool. And I used to be Kremlin pool correspondent, so we said hi to each other, you know. But I can't call him, if that's what you mean. 
GREENE: Do you have an opinion about him as president and his policies? 
SIMONYAN: I have tons of opinions about him as president and his policies. To understand Russia's fascination about Putin - and I think this is something that is completely not being understood in the West and in the mainstream media. And the reason why it's not being understood is because people didn't live here through the '90s. 
In a town like mine, I probably, at that time, wouldn't name a single person whom I personally knew who wanted to stay in Russia. Can you imagine that? All of the people I knew wanted to leave because we saw our country as something horrible, falling apart, that will only continue to fall apart. There were numerous wars going on. And then came Putin, and he stops all that. And we saw it in our lives. People around started - first of all, they stopped being hungry. Then they stopped having one pair of shoes for both my sister and me, you know, and wearing them in a row - and my mom. So for three of us (laughter), one pair of normal shoes - that all stopped. It all seemed magic. 
GREENE: Given those personal reflections and your life improving, I just think about... 
SIMONYAN: Not just mine - it's everybody I know. And when I'm saying - I want to underline this. It would be an extremely difficult task to find a single person who lived worse before Putin than now, very difficult. 
GREENE: You know, I think about the United States. And some of the proudest moments for news organizations in the U.S. have been when investigations have ended up confronting power. I mean, I think of Bill Clinton and the scandals that he got involved in, the reporting around that. I think of Richard Nixon and his ultimate resignation. If investigations revealed things about Vladimir Putin that could ultimately lead to him leaving office, would you be ready to carry out an investigation like that to its fullest here? 
SIMONYAN: If I saw and if I really sincerely thought that what Putin is doing is harmful for my country and for my people and it needs to be stopped, I wouldn't hesitate to do that. 
GREENE: This - that's not - I think you recognize this. That's not your image or RT's image on the outside. 
SIMONYAN: I understand that. I understand that. What are you going to do, you know, when the mainstream media, again and again and again, publish stories about us that are completely false? You know, that's the image. Why do they do that? You tell me. I don't know. 
GREENE: Thank you for this conversation. 
SIMONYAN: Thank you. 
GREENE: I really appreciate it. 
SIMONYAN: Thank you. It's good talking to you.

It is Britain’s second disastrous political gamble in just two years, following ex-Prime Minister David Cameron’s 2016 referendum on EU membership. He resigned following the Brexit vote. 
After meeting Queen Elizabeth II Friday, May said she intended to form a minority government to break the deadlock of a so-called “hung parliament"" and give the country ""certainty."" 
However, Britain faces the real prospect of yet another election — Britain’s last minority government, in 1974, lasted only nine months. “ We believed the polls and we were cocky” 
And May’s stated goal of unifying the country with “strong and stable leadership” is now utterly out of reach. 
Yvette Cooper, a former government minister and lawmaker with the opposition Labour Party, said May was fundamentally weakened “after losing what was basically a referendum on herself.” Theresa May promised a ""strong and stable government"" but failed to deliver in Thursday's election. Toby Melville / Reuters 
How did May throw away what opinion polls suggested was a 20-point lead in under two months? 
Senior figures in her party blame a faltering campaign, in which she refused to take part in TV debates, and an unpopular manifesto that gifted votes to left-wing rival Jeremy Corbyn , who leads the Labour Party.

In particular, May was forced to perform a mid-campaign reversal over a policy that would see people pay more towards elderly care — a plan quickly attacked as an unfair ""dementia tax."" 
“The manifesto, which was drafted by her and about two other people, was a total disaster and must go down now as one of the worst in history by a governing party,” former Conservative Treasury minister George Osborne said. “I say one of the worst … I actually can’t think of a worse one.” Upgrading my declaration in @thetimes from worst Tory campaign since before First World War to worst since Napoleonic Wars — Iain Martin (@iainmartin1) June 9, 2017 
May’s campaign also carries a lesson for election tactics in the modern era. 
A senior Conservative source told Reuters that the party’s campaign relied too much on strict message discipline and that May’s mantra of “strong and stable leadership” was repeated so often that it became a joke. 
By the end of the seven week run-up, May had earned the moniker ""Maybot"" for her robotic performances. 
""We overestimated the campaign team at the top,"" Reuters quoted the source as saying. ""We believed the polls and we were cocky.""

By contrast, the unpolished style of the socialist Corbyn won over voters — as did his focus on issues such as college fees, health services and austerity.

Britain's prime minister gambled by calling early elections — it backfired.
DAVID GREENE, HOST: 
And I'm David Greene in Moscow. You know, so much of the news in Washington points right here to the Russian capital. It's one reason we're spending the next few days here.
STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: 
And Moscow, of course, is quite a place - quite a place to hear dramatic testimony that touches on Russia, testimony that's been taking place in Washington.
GREENE: Yeah, and we were listening here, Steve. It was, of course, former FBI Director James Comey sitting before the Senate intelligence committee and explaining in a whole lot of detail the president's alleged attempts to derail his Russia investigation. Here's one lengthy exchange Comey had with Democratic Senator Mark Warner.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MARK WARNER: February 14 - again, it seems a bit strange - you were in a meeting, and your direct superior, the attorney general, was in that meeting as well. Yet the president asked everyone to leave, including the attorney general to leave, before he brought up the matter of General Flynn. What was your impression of that type of action? And had you ever seen anything like that before?
JAMES COMEY: No. My impression was something big is about to happen. I need to remember every single word that is spoken. And again, I could be wrong. I'm 56 years old. I've been - seen a few things. My sense was the attorney general knew he shouldn't be leaving, which is why he was lingering. And I don't know Mr. Kushner well, but I think he picked up on the same thing. And so I knew something was about to happen that I needed to pay very close attention to.
INSKEEP: Comey says he did pay close attention, and he took extensive notes on that and numerous other conversations with the president of the United States. NPR's Susan Davis covered yesterday's Senate intelligence committee hearing at which all of this was covered, and she's in our studios. Good morning.
SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.
INSKEEP: So a lot was already known of Comey's side of the story apparently because he leaked it he now acknowledges. What more did you learn that you didn't know?
DAVIS: I would say my top three revelations from the hearing were this - one was the chestnut that Comey dropped in the hearing room that he was certain that Special Counsel Robert Mueller will determine whether there was any obstruction of justice. That was a tantalizing little moment because it suggested that the special counsel investigation has expanded to answer that question.
INSKEEP: Involve obstruction of justice.
DAVIS: Two, as you said, that Comey was a leaker, that he acknowledged in a public forum that he leaked his memo to - through a friend to The New York Times for the intention of getting a special counsel nominated. And he was successful in that. And I would say, Steve, from my vantage point on Capitol Hill, the revelation in a question and answer with Senator Lindsey Graham where he was asked, do you think the Russians will meddle in the 2018 mid-term elections, and Comey said, yes, I do. And that raises the question - what's the U.S. going to do about it?
INSKEEP: And of course, this hearing was all about what has happened in the past and arguing over that and not getting to that future question. But I'd like to know, Sue Davis, you said that Comey brought up obstruction of justice in that kind of careful, tantalizing way. Was he actually building a case for obstruction of justice without explicitly saying so?
DAVIS: Well, you know, and what he said is he would not answer legal questions there and legal question - that is not the forum for legal questions. But it is absolutely now the purview of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and that is the million-dollar question going forward.
INSKEEP: How's the White House responding?
DAVIS: They - a very confident defense. The president sent his lawyer out to dispute and say that, you know, take issue with most of what Comey testified. The party is very much behind the president. The RNC set up a rapid response team in defense of the president. The top leaders in Congress are defending the president. So the party is very much aligned behind him, and they are at least building a muscular defense of him.
INSKEEP: And some of the Republican senators offered - I wouldn't say explicitly partisan but very careful questioning of James Comey and close questioning of James Comey. And then there's Paul Ryan, speaker of the House, who was asked about this at a press conference inevitably, and here's part of his response.
(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)
PAUL RYAN: The president's new at this. He's new to government, and so he probably wasn't steeped in the long-running protocols that established the relationships between DOJ, FBI and White Houses. He's just new to this.
INSKEEP: OK, OK. He is new to this. He is new to this, but when he was campaigning, didn't the president say that if he won he would know more than anybody and didn't he seem to know enough that he wanted everybody out of the room when he had these conversations with James Comey?
DAVIS: He also has staff and a legal counsel, so I'm not sure that defense really works. But from the political standpoint, this follows with what Republicans have always said about President Trump, is that he is unconventional. And they seem to put this in the same bucket as unconventional where Democrats see something that may be unlawful.
INSKEEP: OK, I want to focus on another name and bring in another voice. The name is Attorney General Jeff Sessions. There's some focus on him, and we're going to discuss that with our national security correspondent, Mary Louise Kelly, who's been following all this like David from Moscow. Hi, Mary Louise.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Hey there, Steve.
INSKEEP: Wasn't Sessions supposed to have recused himself from all this? How's his name even coming up?
KELLY: Well, he is recused from all of this. The reason why, the original explanation given by Sessions, was that he was part of the Trump campaign, and therefore he should not be part of an investigation into the Trump campaign. However, it should be noted he did not make that decision, didn't make the call to step aside, until it came out that he said something that's been seen as misleading during his confirmation hearing. You may remember he said he had no communications with Russians during the campaign when, in fact, it has since emerged he met at least twice with the Russian ambassador to Washington, Sergey Kislyak.
INSKEEP: And then there is this revelation from James Comey that even before that all blew up and Sessions formally recused himself, James Comey, the FBI director, wasn't telling everything to his boss, Jeff Sessions. Let's listen.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
COMEY: Our judgment, as I recall, was that he was very close to and inevitably going to recuse himself for a variety of reasons. We also were aware of facts that I can't discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a Russia-related investigation problematic.
INSKEEP: Wow. Is there more to Sessions' story than we know?
KELLY: I mean, what a heck of a big, old bread crumb Comey dropped there about Sessions because it immediately prompts the question, what facts has Comey got that can only be discussed in a classified session? One question that's being floated is whether Sessions had more than two confirmed meetings with the Russian ambassador, which, on the one hand, is not of huge consequence - two meetings, three meetings, does it matter? On the other hand, it becomes harder and harder to defend how Sessions failed to do - failed to mention any meetings at all with Russian officials. So we now have this odd scenario. The attorney general had to recuse himself from the probe. He may himself now be investigated as part of the ongoing probe being conducted by the FBI.
INSKEEP: So much new information and so many more questions, which we'll be pursuing. That's NPR national security correspondent Mary Louise Kelly in Moscow. Mary Louise, thanks.
KELLY: You are very welcome.
INSKEEP: And also NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis here in Washington. Susan, thanks to you.
DAVIS: Thanks, Steve.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
INSKEEP: OK. Who could have guessed? Who could have guessed that in 2017 if you called an election, it might not turn out exactly as you planned?
GREENE: Yeah. It certainly didn't turn out as planned in Britain, Steve. Prime Minister Theresa May called for a snap election back in April, and she was thinking this would be a chance for a huge landslide. Well, that proved to be a huge miscalculation. Last night, her Conservative/Tory Party actually lost seats and no longer has a ruling majority in Parliament. Here's what Jeremy Corbyn of the opposition Labour Party had to say.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JEREMY CORBYN: The prime minister called the election because she wanted a mandate. Well, the mandate she's got is lost Conservative seats, lost votes, lost support and lost confidence. I would have thought that's enough to go actually.
INSKEEP: NPR London bureau chief Frank Langfitt was there on election night. And, Frank, what was it like to be there?
FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: It was crazy, Steve. This was something that started off looking like a cakewalk. People had been talking about May as the next Margaret Thatcher, and it was just a complete disaster. The only thing that could have made it worse is if she'd actually lost Parliament to the Labour Party; seen as a huge miscalculation on her part, ran a terrible campaign and now her - she's a threat. I mean, this morning, I was coming through Waterloo station, and a lot of people, ordinary people, as well as people in her party, are staying - saying she should step down. She's saying she's going to stay. We'll be hearing from her later this morning.
INSKEEP: Just want to make sure we understand the basics here - the conservatives still got the most seats...
LANGFITT: They have the most seats, yes, but what they...
INSKEEP: But not a majority.
LANGFITT: No. And so what they're going to have to do if they want to do anything is find another party that will work with them. And they're looking at the Ulster Unionists up in Northern Ireland. They may be just enough to have a small majority, but this kind of cobbled together coalition tends to be very unstable. And it may not last, and there could be more elections, frankly, later on.
INSKEEP: And huge global consequences because Britain is in the middle of Brexit, trying to get out of the European Union. She called this election for that reason.
LANGFITT: This is - yeah, and the whole idea was that she would actually strengthen her power here domestically, then when she went to Brussels to negotiate leaving the EU, she would be seen as a very powerful person. No - Brexit negotiations start later this month. And I don't know what they're going to look - no one knows what they're going to look like. I mean, basically, the voters obviously don't like her ideas, and she - it's not even sure that she'll still be prime minister. So you're going into something that's enormous for this country, and there's no - there's no roadmap.
INSKEEP: We have a quote from the European Parliament's top Brexit official today saying the British election result is, quote, ""yet another own goal.""
LANGFITT: Yeah. I don't know quite with that means, but I don't have any...
INSKEEP: (Laughter) It means scoring on yourself.
LANGFITT: I guess scoring on your own...
INSKEEP: It's a sporting metaphor.
LANGFITT: I mean, it is the biggest - it's a very big self-inflicted wound.
INSKEEP: All right.
LANGFITT: And I think people - people are stunned.
INSKEEP: (Laughter) OK, Frank, thanks very much, really appreciate it.
LANGFITT: Happy to do it, Steve.
INSKEEP: That's NPR's Frank Langfitt in London, where a surprising election result has left Conservatives with less than a majority in Parliament, a story we'll continue to cover.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: 
We could see some confrontations around this country tomorrow. The group ACT for America is known for its criticism of Islam, and it's leading a march against Sharia in at least 19 states. Sharia laws are principles that guide the behavior of observant Muslims. Some civil rights leaders see these marches as provocative, and counterprotests are likely, as NPR's Tom Gjelten reports.
TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: These marches are largely the brainchild of Scott Presler, a 29-year-old Republican activist now working with ACT for America.
SCOTT PRESLER: This was born on the Internet from me sending out a Twitter post saying, hey, I would love to do a rally. Who wants to help?
GJELTEN: As a gay man, Presler says he was first motivated to fight Muslim extremism after the deadly Orlando shooting last June. The target there was a gay nightclub. The perpetrator allegedly pledged loyalty to ISIS. When he proposed the idea of an anti-Sharia rally, he says he got a flood of responses.
PRESLER: My email has been just pummeled with activity. We have people who still want to have their own rallies across the country.
DENISE ZAMORA: So this is going to be our meeting spot. We're going to do a prayer. I have a singer that's going to sing the national anthem and ""My Country, 'Tis Of Thee.""
GJELTEN: Denise Zamora is one of those who responded to Scott Presler's call. She's organized a march against Sharia in San Bernardino, Calif. It'll be near the site of the 2015 shooting there, when a radicalized Pakistani-American and his wife shot and killed 14 people.
ZAMORA: I wasn't even familiar with anything about Sharia law. I didn't really know much about radical Muslims, jihad. I wasn't educated. So I started learning a little bit about, you know, everything. And when ACT for America announced that they were going to do a nationwide march, I quickly volunteered.
GJELTEN: Zamora's big issue and one highlighted in all the marches is female genital mutilation practiced in some conservative Muslim societies. But the marches are in danger of veering in an extremist direction. ACT for America has a somewhat militant attitude toward Islam, and the marches are now attracting a large number of far-right sympathizers. In Arkansas, one was organized by Billy Roper, a white supremacist who touted the marches this week on his podcast.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BILLY ROPER: We want to send a message to Muslims that they are not welcome in our communities. They're not welcome in our state. And ultimately, want to send a message to Muslims that they are not welcome in our nation and, of course, endgame, on our planet.
GJELTEN: Roper specifically invited white nationalists to attend the marches and bring weapons. When word of the podcast got out Scott Presler, the national organizer, put out a statement that the Arkansas march was no longer sanctioned by ACT for America. But left-wing militants had already promised to show up at the anti-Sharia rallies and confront the marchers. Right-wing paramilitary groups such as the Oath Keepers offered to provide private security at the rallies.
STEWART RHODES: We're encouraging our members to go to each and every one of them.
GJELTEN: Stewart Rhodes is the Oath Keepers president. Rhodes says the Oath Keepers will defend the anti-Sharia speakers and marchers from anyone who challenges them.
RHODES: You know, where the police stand up, we'll stand down. But where they stand down, we have to stand up.
GJELTEN: And that's the scenario where trouble could ensue given that Saturday's marches are now due to take place in at least 27 cities across the country. Tom Gjelten, NPR News.

toggle caption Bill Pugliano/Getty Images President Trump delivers a speech Wednesday in Cincinnati, Ohio, on transportation and infrastructure projects. But his plan still leaves a lot to be desired.
Bill Pugliano/Getty Images Despite America's rapt attention on former FBI Director James Comey's testimony , the White House has been observing Infrastructure Week. Infrastructure one of the only policy areas that could have crossover appeal, but there has been little real movement so far on getting something through Congress.
To kick off the festivities, the president on Monday pushed his plan to privatize air-traffic control. And on Wednesday, he touted his broader infrastructure spending plan. The basic idea of this plan is that the government will spend $200 billion, using tax breaks to incentivize private business to, in turn, spend more money on infrastructure projects. Altogether, with state and local contributions as well, spending would total $1 trillion. The administration also said that it would cut regulations to help the government ""get out of the way"" of building projects.
Politics Trump Is Worried About The Trade Deficit With Germany. He Needn't Be Those are the basic outlines of the infrastructure proposal that the administration has been talking about throughout Trump's first four months in office. However, there's still not a detailed plan, nothing has been introduced in Congress and answers to some big questions remain elusive.
The administration will have to figure out those details before it formally introduces its plan (and isn't simply touting it to attempt a diversion from the Comey testimony). Here are a few more of the questions the administration will have to ask itself — and, perhaps, transportation policy wonks — if the White House is hoping to implement the plan.
1. Where are the details? 
Trump's speech in Cincinnati Wednesday and a subsequent press release contained little new information on how his plan would work. The administration had said ahead of time that it would be announcing new spending on rural infrastructure, for example. That kind of spending might calm the fears of some rural residents, after Trump's initial budget proposed slashing rural development and transportation spending.
But in a Wednesday press release on the plan, the only details were:
""Rural America will receive grants to rebuild crippled bridges, roads, and waterways.""
A White House spokesperson told NPR via email on Wednesday that there are no further details on that spending.
Politics Trump's Approval Rating Decline Isn't That Big Compared With Predecessors' Drops And while the plan released Wednesday also said the government would spend $200 billion, it didn't say how that spending would break down — how much would be for tax credits, and how much would be for grants, for example. The White House spokesperson likewise said those details are not available.
One other question, says one expert, is what the specifics of these partnerships between the government and the private businesses will look like.
""The idea that you can spur a larger amount of infrastructure funding than the federal dollars is not, in and of itself, unique,"" said Jacob Leibenluft, a senior adviser at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning fiscal policy think tank. ""But it's pretty important to explain how you do it.""
2. How many jobs could it really create? 
Trump promotes jobs as a big selling point of his infrastructure plan. But given current economic conditions, the job creation could be underwhelming.
Politics GOP Health Plan Would Leave 23 Million More Uninsured, Budget Office Says ""The administration talks jobs, jobs, jobs, but I think most economists would recognize that we have the unemployment rate quite low,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the right-leaning American Action Forum and a former head of the Congressional Budget Office. ""The number of new jobs that would be created is limited.""
There could be some economic boosts, Holtz-Eakin added, but it might not show up in those headline jobs numbers. Rather, he said, there are other potential benefits.
""It would be a productivity improvement, and that will show up in higher wages more than in higher jobs,"" Holtz-Eakin predicted.
There are also certainly other benefits of infrastructure projects — smooth roads and non-crumbling bridges, for example — but as jobs are a big selling point here, it's worth asking how big the effect would actually be.
One related question is about the nature of the projects the tax credits might spur. They are designed to incentivize building, but it's possible, Leibenluft warned, that builders would take the credits on projects they would have done anyway. ""Your hope would be that they're only supporting projects that wouldn't happen otherwise,"" he said.
3. Could the plan be undercut by other federal infrastructure spending cuts? 
In the president's budget proposal, the $200 billion would be spent over the next 10 years. But other infrastructure spending would take a hit over the next decade, Leibenluft pointed out in a blog post this week.
The president's budget would cut Amtrak spending, for example, and it would ensure that the Highway Trust Fund doesn't dole out any more than it takes in in revenue. The fund has some major fiscal problems, and a 2015 CBO report showed a shortfall projected to grow in the coming decade. Part of the funding issue is that gas tax revenues have fallen off. (The gas tax pays for the fund.) But how to fix the fund's shortfalls is a topic for a different article.
All of which is to say: the Trump administration's budget focuses heavily on cutting spending. But whatever infrastructure spending is cut means the trillion-dollar plan could have that much more ground to make up, both in terms of projects and economic gains.
4. Will state and local governments be able to afford it? 
Infrastructure spending comes from a mix of federal, state and local sources. In fact, only around a quarter of total spending on transit and highways comes from the federal government, according to a May 2014 report from the Pew Charitable Trusts.
The question then is to what degree this plan could leave state and local governments to pony up more money. Earlier information from the White House on its infrastructure proposal said the plan would ""support more communities moving toward a model of independence,"" arguing that local officials know necessary infrastructure programs better than the federal government.
Some state and local officials have balked at this idea of ""self-help,"" as Bloomberg reported earlier this year, saying that they may not be able to afford the kind of investment their infrastructure needs.
""Our citizens think they're overtaxed today,"" said Oklahoma City Republican Mayor Mick Kornett , as reported by Bloomberg. ""If the idea is that we're going to somehow pass initiatives with funding to keep up the roads and the bridges and all of the infrastructure that's out there, that seems like a tough sell to me.""",Trump's Infrastructure Plan Still Could Use More Planning,normal,ab0309d66a63a41df7c515230a189a3fe50eb0df

Reviewer Justin Chang calls the film an ""elegantly acerbic new comedy.""
DAVE DAVIES, HOST: 
This is FRESH AIR. The director Miguel Arteta and the screenwriter Mike White have collaborated several times in the past on the movies ""Chuck & Buck"" and ""The Good Girl"" as well as the HBO series ""Enlightened."" Their latest ""Beatriz At Dinner"" starring Salma Hayek is about race, class and culture divisions that arise at a dinner party that goes terribly wrong. Film critic Justin Chang has this review.
JUSTIN CHANG, BYLINE: In the elegantly acerbic new comedy, ""Beatriz At Dinner,"" Salma Hayek plays Beatriz, a Mexican-American immigrant who lives in Los Angeles with her dogs and her goats and performs massages and other healing therapies at a holistic treatment center. She's a soulful-nurturing type with a winsome Earth Mother demeanor that inevitably leads some to dismiss her as meek and unsophisticated.
But the writer, Mike White, and the director, Miguel Arteta, deftly turn that assumption on its head. The story begins when Beatriz's car breaks down at the Newport Beach estate of a wealthy client and family friend named Cathy played by Connie Britton. She invites Beatriz to stay for the fancy dinner that her husband Grant played by David Warshofsky has planned for some very important coworkers.
The first guests to arrive are a good-looking young couple played by Jay Duplass and Chloe Sevigny, whom Beatriz greets with a hug. They're nonplussed but polite. The star of the evening is Doug Strutt, a billionaire real-estate mogul played by a marvelous John Lithgow, arriving with his wife played by Amy Landecker. Doug is an arrogant blowhard and an unapologetically monstrous human being with a chain of luxury hotels that have wreaked social and environmental havoc in developing countries worldwide.
Laughing it up with the boys on the patio, Doug takes one look at Beatriz and, mistaking her for the help, asks her to refresh his drink. From there, the evening gets steadily worse. But the movie just keeps getting better as Arteta and White raise the emotional temperature by delicious incremental degrees. In one scene, as a caterer is about to take everyone's dinner orders, Beatriz gently but firmly takes hold of the conversation and steers it in a different direction.
(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""BEATRIZ AT DINNER"")
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) I hope that this is the beginning of a long partnership between Ryden and Ryfe. And I think that we are all going to make a lot of money.
(LAUGHTER)
UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As character) Cheers, cheers.
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) Tonight you have a choice of two entrees. The chef has prepared...
SALMA HAYEK: (As Beatriz) I would just like to say to Kathy and Grant, thank you for having me tonight. I know you were not expecting me. But I love Tara. I love your family. And I love being in your house. And it's an honor to meet all of you.
CONNIE BRITTON: (As Cathy) Oh, so sweet. Thank you.
HAYEK: (As Beatriz) And I would like to give you all treatments free, of course, as my way of saying thank you for including me tonight.
BRITTON: (As Cathy) Oh, no, Beatriz, you don't have to do that.
JOHN LITHGOW: (As Doug) A treatment? What do you mean?
UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS: (As character) She's a masseuse, Doug. She gives massages.
LITHGOW: (As Doug) We're getting free massages? All of us? At the same time? (Laughter).
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) Oh, you wish, you sicko.
(LAUGHTER)
HAYEK: (As Beatriz) You would have to come to the center in Santa Monica. I have an office.
LITHGOW: (As Doug) You have an office? Good for you.
CHANG: At first, you may wonder if the movie, with its squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water comedy, is inviting you to share the other guests' condescension toward Beatriz. But that confusion soon passes. And the film makes its sympathies very clear. It isn't intelligence that Beatriz lacks. It's guile. And she has neither the aptitude nor the patience for small talk.
Her inhibitions fading with each new glass of wine, Beatriz confronts Doug and the other guests on a daring range of topics, including immigration, the environment and animal rights. Even before Doug busts out photos from his latest African hunting expedition, it's clear enough that ""Beatriz At Dinner"" is a barbed allegory for our present political moment.
At the recent Sundance Film Festival, just a few days after the presidential inauguration, White acknowledged that the film, which was partly inspired by the outrage over the 2015 killing of Cecil the lion, had now taken on even more resonance in the era of Donald Trump. But to its credit, this queasily funny and suspenseful movie is more than just a self-satisfied exercise in ideological deck stacking.
There's a mischievous vibe here that recalls the great bourgeois skewering of Louis Sponwell (ph) particularly the way the story keeps building and releasing tension until a violent end seems inevitable. And Lithgow's performance is too nuanced, too intricately filigreed for Doug to be mistaken for a Trump stand-in. But ""Beatriz At Dinner"" finally rests on the shoulders of its title character.
Hayek may be Hollywood royalty. But her transformation goes well beyond Beatriz's flat bangs and ponytail. There's a wonderful mellowness to her performance that at first seems of a peace with her character's neo-hippie lifestyle until you realize that Beatriz isn't just drifting or spacing out. She's leaning in, trying to figure out what brought her to this dinner table and why her destiny and Doug's have become so improbably entwined.
Why are we here? What difference can we make? These are questions that Beatriz takes incredibly seriously. And they will resonate with anyone who has ever considered the perpetually troubled state of humanity and felt a deep inconsolable despair. The movie's disturbing conclusion is that the world is full of Doug Strutts. And as satisfying as it might be to call them to account, they never really go away.

This winter, Jameria Miller would often run to her high school Spanish class, though not to get a good seat. 
She wanted a good blanket. 
""The cold is definitely a distraction,"" Jameria says of her classroom's uninsulated, metal walls. 
Her teacher provided the blankets. First come, first served. Such is life in the William Penn School District in an inner-ring suburb of Philadelphia. 
The hardest part for Jameria, though, isn't the cold. It's knowing that other schools aren't like this. 
They're always going to be a step ahead of us. They'll have more money than us, and they'll get better jobs than us, always. Jameria Miller, student 
Before her family moved closer to the city, where they could afford more living space, she attended the more affluent Upper Moreland district, which is predominantly white and, according to state and local records, spends about $1,200 more per student than William Penn. 
That difference adds up, Jameria says, to better buildings, smaller class sizes, take-home textbooks and less teacher turnover. 
""It's never going to be fair,"" she says, comparing her life now to her former classmates. ""They're always going to be a step ahead of us. They'll have more money than us, and they'll get better jobs than us, always."" Enlarge this image

Pixie Dust 
""It's not about the dollars,"" says Stan Saylor, chairman of the education committee in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives. ""It's where that local school district spent those dollars over the last many years."" 
And Saylor is not alone. About The 'School Money' Project 
School Money is a nationwide collaboration between NPR's Ed Team and 20 member station reporters exploring how states pay for their public schools and why many are failing to meet the needs of their most vulnerable students. This story is Part 2 of 3. Join the conversation on Twitter by using #SchoolMoney . 
""Money isn't pixie dust,"" declared the Texas assistant solicitor general, arguing his state's side of a school funding lawsuit before the Texas Supreme Court. ""Funding is no guarantee of better student outcomes."" 
This idea, that sprinkling more dollars over troubled schools won't magically improve test scores or graduation rates, is a common refrain among many politicians, activists and experts. And they have research to back it up. 
This report on school spending from the libertarian Cato Institute is just one entry in a decades-long body of work that suggests there is little to no link between spending and academic achievement. And so, again ... 
""Use the money you have more wisely and educate our children,"" says Jon Caldara of Colorado's Independence Institute, a free-market think tank. 
In short, these critics say, it's How You Spend School Money, not How Much You Spend . 
This debate has raged for at least half a century, and today we're going to put both sides under a microscope. 
It's not about the dollars. It's where that local school district spent those dollars over the last many years. Pennsylvania state Rep. Stan Saylor, a Republican 
What follows here, as with the first installment in the School Money series, is a wrap-up of our reporting. For nearly every name and place, you'll find a hyperlink to more. 
Last week, we explored the question, ""How do we pay for our public schools?"" 
This week, we ask: ""What difference can a dollar make in our schools?"" 
Or, better yet, ""Is money pixie dust?"" 
The answer begins in a place not known for magic: Congress. 
The Coleman Report 
Section 402 of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 is short, just a paragraph long, but it demanded something huge: The federal government had to conduct a nationwide survey ""concerning the lack of availability of equal educational opportunities for individuals by reason of race, color, religion, or national origin."" The results were to be reported back to Congress. 
James S. Coleman, a sociologist, was tapped for the job. And he did not take it lightly. By the time Coleman filed his 700-page report , he and his team had surveyed some 650,000 students and teachers nationwide. 
James S. Coleman, 1958. JHU Sheridan Libraries/Gado/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption JHU Sheridan Libraries/Gado/Getty Images 
""It was the most comprehensive data set, that was nationally representative, ever collected,"" says Kirabo Jackson, a researcher at Northwestern University. ""It's actually the first time anyone had collected data that linked the characteristics of children in the home to their outcomes in school."" 
The day Coleman released his report, in 1966, Eric Hanushek was a graduate student in economics at MIT, eagerly hunting for a thesis project. He found it in one of Coleman's headline findings. 
""Coleman explicitly said families are important and, after that, schools contribute very little,"" recalls Hanushek, now a senior fellow with the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. ""And also that resources contribute very little."" 
Family matters, Coleman found; schools matter less. And how much money schools spend on their students doesn't seem to matter much at all. 
""This is crazy,"" Hanushek remembers thinking. ""If schools don't matter, why do we pay so much attention to them?"" 
In the decades since, Hanushek has become a chief spokesman for the How You Spend movement, arguing that pouring more money into troubled schools won't necessarily fix them. To make his case, he offers a few examples. Here's one: 
Camden, N.J. 
Something remarkable happened in New Jersey in the late 1990s. 
As part of a long-running school funding lawsuit known as Abbott v. Burke, the state increased spending in 31 of its then-poorest districts, dubbed Abbott districts. In fact, they got so much new money that spending in some of them eclipsed spending in some of the state's wealthiest districts. School Funding In New Jersey 
Credit: Katie Park/NPR 
This remarkable investment in New Jersey's poorest schools turned heads and made headlines across the country. And, if money truly matters, Hanushek says, then the Abbotts should be a success story. 
But, he points out, all these years later, many are still ""spending 2.5 times the national average, and there's no real evidence that they're closing the achievement gap or that they're doing significantly better."" 
One of those districts, Camden, is spending roughly $23,000 per student this year. And Hanushek is right about the results. While schools there have improved under Superintendent Paymon Rouhanifard, student performance is still abysmal. 
A third of the district's seniors don't graduate on time, and more than 90 percent of high school students there are not proficient in either language arts or math. 
Part of the problem has been mismanagement. Before Rouhanifard, Camden struggled with corruption and went through 13 superintendents in 20 years. 
Much of that extra money is also paying for important things that had long been ignored. 
""If you read the stories about Camden from the early '90s, late '80s, it was a really, really horrendous situation,"" says Rouhanifard. ""Schools couldn't offer basic meals for their kids. They didn't even have cafeterias. They didn't have basic textbooks."" 
If kids are coming to school without the basic health and nutritional supports, you need to do that. Linda Darling-Hammond, Stanford University 
He says the additional funding changed that, and to focus only on low test scores overlooks the good it's done. 
Perhaps the biggest challenge facing Camden's schools boils down to one word: poverty. 
Nearly half of the district's students live in poverty and nearly all qualify for free- or reduced-price lunch. 
In high-poverty districts, children often arrive at school needing things that more affluent districts simply don't have to provide — but providing them won't necessarily improve test scores. 
And this challenge extends well beyond Camden. Nationwide, 1 in 5 children lives in poverty. 
""If kids are coming to school without the basic health and nutritional supports, you need to do that,"" says Linda Darling-Hammond, who studies school policy at Stanford University. 
Darling-Hammond says any educator will tell you: It's tough to teach a child who is chronically hungry. Or sick. Or cold, like Jameria in Philadelphia. 
But, as with textbooks and teacher salaries, addressing the symptoms of poverty costs schools precious money.

'Doomed' Without Preschool 
To meet the needs of its disadvantaged students, North Carolina has focused much of its effort — and dollars — on one big intervention: preschool. 
In the 1990s, a handful of low-income districts sued the state, arguing insufficient funding. Wake County Superior Court Judge Howard Manning found that, for most students, the state's schools and their funding were good enough. 
It was a different story, though, for what Manning called ""at-risk"" students — among them, kids with disabilities, living in poverty or learning English as a second language. In his October 2000 decision, Manning didn't mince words: 
""At-risk children, who are not presently in quality pre-kindergarten educational programs, are being denied their fundamental constitutional right to receive the equal opportunity to a sound basic education.""

Chris Seward/News Observer hide caption toggle caption Chris Seward/News Observer Superior Court Judge Howard Manning presides over a Leandro education hearing in a Wake County courtroom on July 23, 2015. Manning retired last year. Chris Seward/News Observer 
Manning ordered the state to provide free preschool for any child considered at-risk. Not as an option, he argued, but as an obligation. 
""The Court is not so naïve as to think that every single at-risk child will be an academic superstar as a result of this early childhood intervention,"" Manning wrote, ""but the Court is convinced that without this intervention more children will be doomed to the academic basement."" 
A new study from the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University is just the latest to suggest that preschool, when it's high-quality, can narrow achievement gaps before they grow too wide. 
With strong support from the state's then-new governor, Mike Easley, the program grew quickly. At peak enrollment, in the 2008-09 school year, it provided free preschool to roughly 35,000 at-risk kids at a cost of $170 million. 
Did it work? 
Ellen Peisner-Feinberg, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has studied the state's pre-K program since it began. She's found that children who attend make greater-than-expected gains in kindergarten. 
""This is particularly true with dual-language learners and children who have lower levels of English proficiency,"" says Peisner-Feinberg. 
Without this intervention, more children will be doomed to the academic basement. Judge Howard Manning, North Carolina 
But it's not all good news. 
She found that some of those preschool gains fade by the time these students leave third grade. For state lawmakers, that was one reason to scale back. When the Great Recession hit, they cut the program to serve 6,000 fewer students. 
Judge Manning blamed the fading benefits not on the preschool program but on the lackluster schooling that many students received in later years. 
""They've been screwed over by first grade, second grade, third grade,"" said Manning in a presentation at North Carolina State University in 2011. ""The academic prop they got [from preschool] fizzled because they probably weren't challenged and were just treated like poor kids without expectations.""

Mission Creep 
To some, the fact that schools are spending money to alleviate the symptoms of poverty is a kind of mission creep. 
At a press conference last year, as the Indiana General Assembly was re-writing its school funding formula, state Rep. Tim Brown, a Republican, put it this way: 
""You know, one of the things about education is money to help those kids who are outside the educational problem. You know, did Mary's mother get arrested the night before? Did Johnny not come with shoes to school? Those aren't to me core issues of education."" 
They affect education ""a lot,"" Brown said, but help should come from outside organizations, not necessarily schools. 
That may explain why lawmakers there decided to scale back the extra money they had been sending to schools that educate lots of disadvantaged kids. School Funding In Indiana 
Credit: Katie Park/NPR 
Those dollars have made a big difference in Goshen, a small, northern Indiana town where low-wage manufacturing jobs have attracted many immigrants. 
More than half of the students there are Latino, the highest concentration of any district in Indiana. And many of those students depend on the district's special English Language (EL) program, which provides extra teachers, teaching assistants, counselors and considerable parent outreach. 
Hector Juarez-Montes, a fifth-grader at West Goshen Elementary, says his special English-language class is his favorite. 
""It's much easier in here to speak than back in our [traditional] classroom because over there you're sort of shy if you mess up on a word,"" he says. ""But here it's safer."" 
When kids like Hector feel safer speaking English in class, they perform better, too. That's one reason Superintendent Diane Woodworth says test scores went up as the number of low-income, Latino students increased in Goshen. 
Last year, state lawmakers voted to fund every district more equally, whether it's in an affluent suburb or a high-poverty community. 
That's meant a cut of some $3 million to Goshen, roughly a third of the cost of its EL program. But Superintendent Woodworth says she's not cutting any services — not yet, anyway. 
""We're not going to go there, because we'll find money,"" she says. ""I'm an eternal optimist."" 
The Magic Wand 
Goshen isn't the only place where extra money has made a difference. 
""A good education in a safe environment is the magic wand that brings opportunity,"" declared the Republican governor of Massachusetts, William Weld, back in 1993, as he signed into law a landmark overhaul of the state's school funding system. ""It's up to us to make sure that wand is waved over every cradle."" 
That magic wand did many things, but chief among them, it gave more state money to districts that educate lots of low-income kids. 
In places like Revere, north of Boston, where nearly 80 percent of students come from low-income families, many of those dollars were spent on people : to hire and keep good teachers and give them better training. 
Karen English has taught in the Revere, Mass., schools for 36 years. Kirk Carapezza/WGBH hide caption toggle caption Karen English has taught in the Revere, Mass., schools for 36 years. Kirk Carapezza/WGBH 
This is key, says Bruce Baker, who studies school funding at Rutgers. ""If you have enough money to hire enough people to have reasonable class sizes and to be able to pay them sufficient wages so that you're getting good people coming into the profession, that's most of the battle of providing quality schooling."" 
Revere didn't stop there. It used the money to give its teachers better materials, too. 
""We noticed the difference right away,"" says Revere's current superintendent, Dianne Kelly. In 1993, she was teaching algebra. ""We adopted a whole new textbook series in the math department. The first year I was here, the textbooks I was using with my students dated — no exaggeration — back to the '50s and '60s."" 
Revere's schools also used the money to hire reading coaches, a technology team — some even lengthened the school day. 
""I really think that the funding was like winning the World Series,"" says Karen English, who grew up in Revere and has taught there for 36 years. 
Today, the district says nearly 90 percent of its high school graduates go on to some form of postsecondary education. That's up from 70 percent in the early '90s. 
And it wasn't just Revere. 
""When you look at Massachusetts' overall performance nationally, we have gone from the middle of the pack to the top of the pack,"" says Paul Reville, a former state education secretary who now teaches at Harvard's Graduate School of Education.

Money Matters 
So, quick recap: While the money in Camden, N.J., has led to relatively little academic progress, our stories from North Carolina, Indiana and Massachusetts offer a compelling counterpoint to the idea that money doesn't really matter. 
So, too, do a pair of recent studies that look not at one state but at many where parents, activists and school leaders from low-income districts sued and won increases in school funding. 
The first, we'll call it Study A , looked at how well these low-income students performed on the NAEP test, the National Assessment of Educational Progress. 
""After the spending increased, test scores slowly, surely increased as a result,"" says one of the researchers, Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach, who is also an associate professor at Northwestern's School of Education and Social Policy. 
The team behind Study A found that the achievement gap between students in high- and low-income districts shrank by roughly 20 percent. By contrast, in states that saw no school-funding reform, that gap didn't shrink at all. It grew. 
Whether or not a school is funded well depends a lot on where that school is located. LA Johnson/NPR hide caption toggle caption 
Now to Study B . 
Instead of test scores, these researchers used very different measures of success: long-term outcomes like educational attainment and a student's income in adulthood. 
Why? One of the authors of this study, Northwestern's Kirabo Jackson, says that important social-emotional skills — sharing, cooperation, persistence — may not show up in a test score, but cultivating them in schools can help a child succeed in later life. 
""They're designed to teach students things like, 'This is how you share. This is how you become a good person.' And these things play out,"" Jackson says. ""If you go to a job interview and you don't understand that you need to show up on time and be polite, you're not going to get that job, no matter how smart you are."" 
Translation: If funding increases helped build students' social-emotional skills, then low test scores wouldn't necessarily mean the money was wasted. 
Indeed, Jackson and his colleagues found a few key benefits when school spending increased steadily, by 10 percent over the 12 years that a low-income child was in school: 
1.) The extra money made poor students less likely to be poor as adults. 
2.) It increased the likelihood that they would graduate from high school by 10 percentage points (7 points for all students). 
3.) And, perhaps most remarkable, the funding led to a nearly 10 percent increase in low-income students' adult earnings. 
Jackson and his fellow researchers studied the effects on all students, but for nonpoor children, he says, funding benefits were ""small"" or ""statistically insignificant."" Only low-income students showed consistently large benefits. 
The Takeaways 
So, is money pixie dust? 
No. If it were, there would be no debate. Or, at least, the debate wouldn't be nearly as loud. 
But, does money matter — especially for low-income students? Even Stanford's Eric Hanushek agrees that it does. 
""Money matters, of course,"" he bristles. ""And I think that's a straw-man way to phrase the question."" 
Make no mistake, money can make a difference in the classroom. If: 
Takeaway #1: The money reaches students who need it most. 
Did Mary's mother get arrested the night before? Did Johnny not come with shoes to school? Those to me are not core issues of education. Indiana state Rep. Tim Brown, a Republican 
""What I see as the ideal in many ways,"" Hanushek says, ""is a system that provides extra resources to kids that need more resources. So this would be ELL kids. Special education kids. Disadvantaged kids in general."" 
In other words, the kind of targeted funding that helped Goshen build its special EL program in Indiana, or that paid for Revere's district-wide reset. 
Takeaway #2: The increases come steadily, year after year. 
For extra money to have an impact, Study B and the story of Revere in Massachusetts suggest that it can't just be a one- or two-year boost. 
The funding was like winning the World Series. Karen English, schoolteacher in Revere, Mass. 
Takeaway #3: The money stays in the classroom: paying, training and supporting strong teachers, improving curriculum and keeping class sizes manageable. 
Money alone does not guarantee success any more than a lack of it guarantees failure. Paul Reville, the former Massachusetts education secretary, says not all districts there were able to translate funding increases into academic gains. Often, the difference was how they spent the extra money. 
And so we come full circle. 
This debate — How You Spend versus How Much You Spend — isn't a debate at all. Or shouldn't be. 
Each depends on the other. 
Extra money spent thoughtlessly is no panacea for what ails many schools. But it's also true that, to pay for the kinds of things (and people) that are most likely to help vulnerable students, many schools need more money. 
Lost in all of this, of course, is perhaps the most important takeaway — a question that all educators, parents and policymakers should ask themselves before they spend a dime: 
Takeaway #4: How do we define success? 
Is it just about test scores? 
Or should our focus widen to include wages, incarceration rates and other life outcomes of kids many years after they leave the nation's schools? 
Because the lesson of Camden and, again, of Study B is that not all school spending, especially on meeting students' basic needs, can be expected to improve test scores. But that doesn't mean it's being misspent or failing the children it's supposed to help.

""There's been a lot of drama among members of Fleetwood Mac,"" Mason said. 
""Oh, you could say that,"" Buckingham said. 
But Buckingham and McVie have never had drama between themselves. 
""Not yet,"" Buckingham joked. The two began working on new songs together when she rejoined Fleetwood Mac after a long absence in 2014. Bandmates John McVie and Mick Fleetwood provide much of the rhythm section on Buckingham-McVie's debut duet album, which makes it an almost-Fleetwood Mac record. Everybody's on the album except Nicks, which had some people wondering if it started as a Fleetwood Mac album. 
""No, it didn't really. There was no idea of saying, 'Oh we're trying to make a Fleetwood Mac album.' It was just, 'Let's get together and have some fun with this.' But as I said, it only took about a week for us to start to get a little territorial about it maybe being a duet album,"" Buckingham said. 
Last month, they took over Sound Stage 22 on the Sony lot in Los Angeles to begin rehearsing for a summer tour. 
McVie has been singing harmonies with Buckingham since he first joined Fleetwood Mac back in 1975 with his then-girlfriend Nicks. 
""It was with Stevie and John, and it was a little studio somewhere,"" McVie said of the first time she and Buckingham sang together. ""I was playing 'Say You Love Me.' And you and Stevie chirped in with fantastic background vocals. And we just all sat, I mean I sat there with goosebumps. I could not believe it."" They'd form the classic lineup of Fleetwood Mac. Their first album together went to number one. Their second, ""Rumours,"" would sell more than 40 million copies. 
But in 1998, tired of the travel and the feuding, McVie quit the band and moved to the English countryside, where she'd stay for 16 years. 
""And it was OK for a few years, and then I just became quite isolated really,"" McVie said. 
McVie did do a solo album during that time. 
""How could I forget? In my garage, we call it 'the dirge' album. Cause I was in a dark space then,"" she said. 
""Did you decide that you're not really a solo artist after all?"" Mason asked. 
""I know I'm not,"" she said. ""I'm not."" McVie took her first tentative steps back into Fleetwood Mac in 2013, when Fleetwood invited her to join them for one gig at London's 02 Arena, a reunion captured on fans' cellphone video. 
""He said, 'Why don't you just come on and do ""Don't Stop"" with us?' So that's, that's in the end what I did,"" she said. ""And looking around at these other four individuals - it was just a mind-blowing experience."" 
Right away, she knew she wanted to go back. 
""There is nothing like this extended family that is Fleetwood Mac. And I think you have to say, for all the perceived and real dysfunction that there has been, underneath that, there is and always has been a great deal of love. And that keeps pulling us back together,"" Buckingham said.

Photo by Toby Melville/Reuters
A move intended to strengthen the hand of British Prime Minister Theresa May backfired Thursday when her party lost seats in the UK Parliament.
May’s Conservative Party lost 12 seats but still retained the largest number in the 650-member House of Commons. The main opposition Labor Party gained 31 seats in Thursday’s snap elections.
May had called for the early elections in the hopes of gaining a larger majority and a stronger mandate when negotiating Britain’s exit from the European Union, known as Brexit. The negotiations are set to begin on June 19 .
The results mean May will need to form a government even as Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the far-left Labor Party, called for her to resign. He tweeted a message to his followers, thanking them for their support:
As polls close, I'd like to say thank you to everyone who has voted for @UKLabour , for a fairer, better Britain, that works #ForTheMany . pic.twitter.com/SgTolSoM00 
— Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn) June 8, 2017 

Corbyn’s Labor Party lobbied against Brexit but has indicated it will honor the results of the UK referendum to leave the EU.
Early polls showed May’s party with a comfortable lead, but the gap closed during the seven-week campaign. As election results became clear early Friday morning, May called for a “period of stability” during the country’s challenging times.
Those challenges include terrorism with recent attacks in Manchester and London prompting some polling stations to add armed guards . May said after the latest attacks that there was “far too much tolerance” for extremism in British society.

""The U.K. looks ungovernable at the moment and that's going to make the Brexit negotiations very difficult,"" Armstrong added. 
The first challenge for the prime minister is actually forming a government. 
In recent years, most British elections have resulted in one party winning more than half of the lawmakers in Parliament, meaning that none of their opponents can block them from passing legislation. 
Because she failed to win enough seats, May said Friday she would attempt to form a government and enlist support from the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland. 
Related: How British PM Threw Away an Election 
But getting the green light from Parliament is not certain, especially considering some of May's own lawmakers are angry about the result. 
After forming a government, May would have to propose a list of laws, known as a ""Queen's Speech,"" which are then voted on by lawmakers. If they reject it, the opposition Labour Party could be given a chance to form a government, and if they fail there could be another election. 
""At that point you have to ask: Is Brexit still on?"" Armstrong said. 
Even if May does manage to form a government, her enfeebled position would likely have an effect on the negotiations themselves. A European Union flag is carried by a protester in front of the U.K. Parliament in London on March 29. Hannah Mckay / Reuters 
May says she wants a so-called ""hard Brexit"" — meaning Britain exiting the European Single Market that guarantees free movement of goods, people, services and capital between member states. 
But her diminished power means this vision could be difficult to accomplish. 
""I'm not quite sure how she will play it,"" said Dr Christine Reh, a lecturer in European politics at University College London. ""It will be extremely difficult for her to pursue a cause that pleases all sides."" 
The prime minister may be forced to water down her plans into something resembling a ""soft Brexit,"" which could mean staying within the European Single Market while making concessions to Brussels.

Another issue is the timing of the negotiations. 
One month before calling the election, the prime minister triggered something called ""Article 50,"" a legal document that starts a two-year countdown to leaving the EU. 
Several commentators said May's decision to trigger Article 50 before calling the election was ""reckless"" and predicted it would weaken the U.K.'s position. This morning, the decision to start the Article 50 clock & then call a surprise election looks like one of the most reckless acts of any PM. — Stewart Wood (@StewartWood) June 9, 2017 May's decision to trigger Article 50 *before* election that resulted in hung parliament was remarkably reckless. — George Eaton (@georgeeaton) June 9, 2017 
Britain now faces the double headache of beginning talks in 10 days while trying to thrash out its own domestic political muddle. 
""There are few words to describe the sheer irresponsibility of the prime minister in triggering Article 50 only to follow it by calling a needless general election,"" lawyer David Allen Green wrote in the Financial Times early Friday . 
The Article 50 process can be paused or postponed, but all 28 EU states would have to agree and ""it would come at political cost to Britain,"" according to Green.

May vowed Friday not to disrupt this timetable — if she survives her lawmakers' wrath and manages to form a government, that is. 
From the European perspective, ""they simply want to get going — they are ready,"" said Reh at University College London. 
The EU's chief Brexit negotiator appeared to strike a conciliatory tone, saying that ""negotiations should start when UK is ready."" #Brexit negotiations should start when UK is ready; timetable and EU positions are clear. Let's put our minds together on striking a deal — Michel Barnier (@MichelBarnier) June 9, 2017 
However, Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister and the European parliament's negotiator for Brexit, called the election ""yet another own goal"" for the U.K. — using a term meaning to score against your own team.

Teens are leaving the workforce in droves, hastening a three-decade trend. Even in the recovery years following the Great Recession, more teens are skipping out on paid labor, while many employers have to hunt for people to fill low-wage jobs. 
What's going on with teens? Older Americans may be tempted to point to teenagers getting lazier, but it's the result of something else entirely: academic ambition. More teens between the ages of 16 to 19 years old are in school, which shrinks the teen labor force. Teens are also more likely to attend school during the summer. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that they are four times as likely to be enrolled in summer school now than in 1985. 
Play Video CBSN Teens not working as much as in the past The viral ""FirstSevenJobs"" hashtag unveiled previous jobs of famous celebrities, but it also highlighted the fact that teens today aren't working... 
""They're thinking about their future from a broader perspective,"" said Christine Russell, a retirement and long-term investing expert at TD Ameritrade ( AMTD ). ""They are going through that cost-benefit analysis and saying, 'I can earn this amount of money, which is a drop in bucket compared to the cost of college, or be focused on what I want to study in college and be a more valuable candidate at college"" with a greater chance for earning scholarships. 
The teen labor force participation rate reached a peak of almost 58 percent in 1979. By 2015, the most recent year of data provided by the BLS, that rate had declined to about 34 percent, which is lower than the Great Recession's 40 percent rate. 
The drop has been even more drastic when it comes to summer jobs, the BLS said. 
""Even though some teens still have summer jobs, the proportion of teens who participate in the labor force during the summer has dropped dramatically,"" the agency said in a report published earlier this year. ""The summer break typically includes July. In July 2016, the teen labor force participation rate was 43.2 percent, down almost 30 percentage points from the high point of 71.8 percent in July 1978.""
Yet a survey of teens by TD Ameritrade found that many may be working -- just not for money. About 56 percent of teens said they prefer an unpaid internship instead of a paid job. The survey also found that about half of teens are working outside of home each month, although some of those jobs could be babysitting or other ""under the table"" work that the BLS might not officially track.

Some teens may also want to work but are unable to find a summer job. Only about 4 out of 10 teens and young adults looking for summer work through 18 employment programs in 15 cities were able to find it, according to study from JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ). 
In that case, it may be that the ranks of adults who are ""underemployed,"" or workers who are working part-time but might want a full-time job, are taking some of the low-wage, unskilled roles that teens might otherwise have filled. 
The downside for teens? It's more than a reduction in pocket money because their top saving goal is for their own education, TD Ameritrade found. 
""They're putting that money away for something in the future,"" said Russell, ""which is great delayed gratification for a teen.""",Endangered rite of passage: Teen summer jobs - CBS News,normal,4c2290840db4412e3a4c67a4ca3e5c5944210e6e

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Friday broke his silence on Twitter following explosive testimony by fired FBI Director James Comey, declaring “total and complete vindication.”
Trump’s Twitter account had been quiet throughout Comey’s testimony accusing the administration of spreading “lies.” But a day after the closely watched hearing, Trump struck back with an early morning tweet: “Wow, Comey is a leaker.”
Trump was expected to face journalists later Friday in a joint news conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, who is visiting the White House.
While Trump might feel vindicated, Comey’s reputation as a truth-teller didn’t seem to take a hit. In his testimony, Comey detailed months of distrust of the president and bluntly asserted that Trump had fired him to interfere with the probe of Russia’s ties to the Trump campaign.
House Speaker Paul Ryan tried to brush off the conclusion as Trump being new to the White House, but Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican, said Congress needs to obtain any tapes the president might have of his dealings with the former FBI director. She called Comey an “honorable individual.”
“I found him to be credible, candid and thorough,” Collins said of Comey on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”
Also in his testimony, Comey revealed that he’d orchestrated the public release of information about his private conversations with the president in an effort to further the investigation.
READ MORE: What does Comey’s testimony mean for the Russia probe? 
Trump’s tweet read: “Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication … and WOW, Comey is a leaker.”
Collins, a member of the Senate intelligence committee, which is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, said Comey’s motivation “may have been a good one.” But, she said, he was wrong to leak his notes to the public and should have given that document to her panel.
Comey’s testimony provided a gripping account of his interactions with Trump and underscored the discord that had soured their relationship.
He portrayed Trump as a chief executive dismissive of the FBI’s independence and made clear that he interpreted Trump’s request to end an investigation into his former national security adviser as an order coming from the president.
The ex-director’s statement deepened questions about the basis for his May 9 dismissal and about whether Trump’s actions constituted obstruction of justice. The veteran lawman expressed confidence that could be a matter ripe for investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, though he declined to offer an opinion on whether it met such a threshold.
Trump’s private attorney, Marc Kasowitz, seized on Comey’s admission that he had told Trump on multiple occasions that he was not personally under investigation and maintained the testimony made clear that Trump “never, in form or substance, directed or suggested that Mr. Comey stop investigating anyone.”
Kasowitz also jumped on Comey’s revelation that he had released details of his private conversations with the president, casting the former FBI director as one of the “leakers” set on undermining the Trump administration.
Still, there was no doubt the veteran lawman made for a challenging adversary.
“It’s my judgment that I was fired because of the Russia investigation,” Comey said toward the end of more than two hours of testimony before the Senate intelligence committee. “I was fired in some way to change, or the endeavor was to change, the way the Russia investigation was being conducted.
“That is a very big deal, and not just because it involves me.”
At one point he practically dared Trump to release any recordings of their conversations, a prospect the president once alluded to in a tweet.
“Lordy, I hope there are tapes,” Comey said, suggesting such evidence would back up his account over the president’s.
READ MORE: Comey says, ‘Lordy, I hope there are tapes’ 
The disclosures that followed Comey’s firing have raised questions about why Comey, known in government for an independent streak and a willingness to buck protocol, did not speak out publicly while on the job, or at least make his objections directly known to the president.
Discussing the meeting in which Comey says Trump asked him to back off Flynn, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California asked, “Why didn’t you stop and say, ‘Mr. President, this is wrong,’?”
“It’s a great question,” Comey replied. “Maybe if I were stronger I would have. I was so stunned by the conversation, I just took it in.”
Comey also made clear that political entanglement in law enforcement has cut across party lines.
During a discussion of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, Comey disclosed that then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch, an Obama administration appointee, instructed him to refer to the issue as a “matter,” not an “investigation.”
“That concerned me because that language tracked how the campaign was talking about the FBI’s work and that’s concerning,” he said. “We had an investigation open at the time so that gave me a queasy feeling.”
Many Democrats still blame Comey for Clinton’s loss, leading Trump to apparently believe they would applaud him for firing Comey. The opposite occurred, as the firing created a political firestorm that has stalled Trump’s legislative agenda and taken over Washington.
Under questioning Thursday, Comey reaffirmed the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia meddled in the election.
“There should be no fuzz on this. The Russians interfered,” Comey stated firmly. “That happened. It’s about as un-fake as you can possibly get.”
Trump has begrudgingly accepted that assessment. But he has also suggested he doesn’t believe it, saying Russia is a “ruse” and calling the investigation into the matter a “witch hunt.”

Legal Scholar Alan Dershowitz spoke with Anderson Cooper on CNN about former FBI Director James Comey's memo about his meetings with Donald Trump. After reading the memo, Dershowitz explained that the President did not obstruct justice because James Comey serves at the will of the President. Dershowitz said presidents have the constitutional authority to impede and direct investigations if they choose. He explained that there is precedent with a president speaking to the FBI Director about investigations, including when President George H.W. Bush ended the investigation of Caspar Weinberger during the Iran-Contra affair. Dershowitz also provided examples from Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Barack Obama who directed their Attorney General or FBI directors to end investigations.

He's very smart, but he overlooks one huge, unmistakably obvious 900 lb. gorilla in the room with Trump and Comey that was never in the room in any of the other examples he sights.
In Trump's case, he fired Comey after numerous meetings and phone calls failed in a quid pro quo Trump attempted to set up to get Comey to drop the investigation into Flynn in exchange for keeping his job.
As a president Trump could have ordered Comey to drop the investigation, as in the examples Dershowitz eluded to. But that is not what he did.
What Trump did was to act like some kind of Godfather by saying to Comey, “I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go...."" after making several references to his staying on at the FBI. Trump then followed up the firing with several personal attacks aimed at impugning Comey's reputation and even going so far as to hint he has tapes of the conversations in a very thinly veiled attempt to intimidate Comey into keeping his mouth shut about their private conversations - conversations Trump initiated, even going so far as to order other govt officials out of the room when he met with Comey in the Oval Office.

Nearly three years ago, the twin artists Lisa-Kaindé and Naomi Díaz burst onto the music scene with their haunting songs “ Oya” and “River,” which were soon followed by remarkable eponymous debut. That first album was lovely, aching, and suffused with a melancholy spirit and Afro-Cuban plays of shade and light. 
However, for the first single from the 22-year-old sisters’ highly anticipated sophomore album, expected later this year on XL, the duo has spun away from brooding into unbridled happiness. 
“Away Away” still bears the hallmarks of their sound: Lisa-Kaindé’s sweet vocals laid atop Naomi’s deeper voice and percussion; haunting electronics; and English lyrics eventually giving way to Yoruba chant. 
But “Away Away” is a song about joy, through and through. The audio version of the song begins with the sound of wailing sirens — a tragically commonplace harbinger of chaos in 2017 — before the buoyant beats kick in; it’s a conscious turn away from grief and worry. By contrast, those warning notes are barely audible in the video; instead, it’s all sweetness and sunshine. 
Directed by Christian Beuchet, the “Away Away” video has a loose, spontaneous and intimate feel, with the artists simply dancing and goofing around in the studio; it’s like the best selfie footage ever. (It doesn’t hurt that the Díaz women are absolutely stunning — a fact that has not escaped the notice of Beyoncé, who had them appear on Lemonade , or the house of Chanel, who cast them in the 2016/17 cruise show .) 
And yet, Ibeyi acknowledges that happiness has its own, inverted twin of sorts. As the song concludes, they shift into the Yoruba language of their Afro-Cuban heritage to sing a chant to the orisha Aggayu. Aggayu is often depicted as a ferryman, the strength-giving figure who provides support in life’s hard moments. In nature, Agayu is also the volcano — and the seething, destructive fiery lava that also provides incredibly fertile soil. And Ibeyi’s recognition of life’s dualities is part of what makes their music such a pleasure. 
Ibeyi goes on a European tour starting this fall.","Watch A Buoyant, Bubbly New Video From Ibeyi : NPR",normal,30f7b0bbd1875f6f6e76ce2f77178c92c764c5d3

Manning, 29, was released in May from a U.S. military prison in Kansas where she had been serving time for passing secrets to the WikiLeaks website in the biggest breach of classified data in the history of the United States. 
She had been working as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. She was convicted by court-martial in 2013 of espionage and other offenses for furnishing more than 700,000 documents, videos and diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks, an international organization that publishes information from anonymous sources. 
Manning came out as transgender shortly after her sentencing, but the military denied her request for hormone therapy treatment while behind bars. She was placed in solitary confinement after attempting suicide twice. 
Manning continued to fight for the treatment, and the authorities ultimately relented. In her ABC interview, she said the hormone therapy was essential.

Las Robertas ' trippy noise-pop garage-rock took the international music scene by storm in 2010, and the band, led by Mercedes Oller, quickly became a darling on the indie festival circuit in Europe as well as the Americas. Now back with a new lineup and a third full-length album, Waves of The New , Las Robertas serves up a sunny set of tunes tinged with surf-rock and psychedelia and surrounded by its hallmark sylphic vocals — all with a retro feel that starts in the '60s and '70s but definitely doesn't stay there. 
The new album shows a maturing of the slightly distorted, vintage garage sound that made Las Robertas a musical referent in its homeland of Costa Rica. Oller and Sonya Carmona's ethereal vocals swirl decidedly about the former's elegant shoegaze guitar chords and the latter's classic-rock bass lines, all grounded and propelled by the krautrocky beats of drummer Fabrizio Durán. <a href=""http://lasrobertas.bandcamp.com/album/waves-of-the-new"">Waves of the New by Las Robertas</a>

Photo by Mohamed Azakir/REUTERS 
An outbreak of vaccine-related polio cases has been reported in war-torn Syria, the World Health Organization announced Thursday — another hurdle for a nearly 30-year eradication effort that has seen more than its share of setbacks. 
Two children in the Deir-Ez-Zor governorate in eastern Syria have been paralyzed by the vaccine viruses. The virus has been recovered from a third child who was not paralyzed. All signs point to vaccine viruses that are circulating in the area. 
Detailed planning is already underway for emergency vaccination programs to reach about 200,000 children in the region, Michel Zaffran, head of the WHO’s polio program, told STAT. The government of Syria has made a formal request for the emergency vaccination effort, he said. 
Given the six-year-old civil war in that country, the endeavor will be logistically challenging. But Syria experienced a polio outbreak in 2013 and 2014, and it was extinguished. 
READ MORE: As hopes for polio eradication rise, the endgame gets complicated, and a vaccine runs short 
In that case, the outbreak was caused by so-called wild polioviruses. The new cases are vaccine-derived polioviruses — viruses from the oral polio vaccine used in some developing countries — and not an indication that the viruses are spreading as they are in Afghanistan and Pakistan, believed to be the only two countries in the world where wild polioviruses still circulate. 
“It’s still complex,” Zaffran admitted. 
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative has a long history of operating in places of political instability and has been successful in the past in negotiating so-called “days of tranquility” in which ceasefires allow vaccination teams to reach otherwise hard-to-reach children. 
In mid-May, an anonymous contributor reported to the online disease surveillance system ProMED that there was a cluster of children who had suffered what’s called acute flaccid paralysis in Syria. Sudden onset of paralysis can be caused by a number of things, but in parts of the world where polio is still a threat, it must be ruled out when such cases arise. 
The polio program has received reports of 58 children in the region who have recently experienced acute flaccid paralysis. Testing showed the vaccine viruses were not responsible in 11 of these cases, but further testing remains to be done on samples from the others. 
Getting samples from Deir-Ez-Zor to laboratories in Damascus and Ankara that can do the testing isn’t easy or quick. 
“This is still a work in progress,” Zaffran said. “We have samples that have reached the lab that have tested negative. We have samples that have reached the lab and have not yet been completely tested. And we have samples that have been collected that are still stuck in Syria and are not yet transported.” 
Oral polio vaccine is made using live but weakened viruses; the original formulation contained components to protect against all three polioviruses, types 1 through 3. Type 2 polioviruses stopped circulating nearly 20 years ago. 
While highly effective, the oral vaccine has some rare but serious side effects. The weakened viruses can spread from a vaccinated child to other children with whom he or she is in contact, also passively vaccinating them. But as the viruses spread from child to child they can mutate to become virulent again, regaining the power to cripple. 
That’s what has happened in Syria. And there may be more cases, Zaffran acknowledged. Sign up to get our Science email We'll explore the wide worlds of science, health and technology with content from our science squad and other places we're finding news. Email Address 
Genetic analysis shows the viruses from the three children are related and have been circulating for a period of about two years, Zaffran said. The fact that vaccine viruses have been circulating for that long suggests a lot of children in the region have not been successfully immunized against polio. 
“That can only happen in populations that have low immunity,” he said. 
The type 2 component of the oral polio vaccine is the most likely of the three to regain virulence. As a result, last year in a globally coordinated maneuver called “ the switch ” all countries that use oral vaccine had to stop administering the three-component type and adopt a version that only protects against type 1 and type 3 polioviruses. 
But supplies of a special monovalent or single-strain vaccine that protects against type 2 polio have been stockpiled in case outbreaks like the type in Syria crop up. This is the vaccine that will be used in this emergency response. 
Zaffran said response planners are hoping to move quickly but must ensure that the effort is effective at reaching as many children as possible. 
That’s because they know putting more type 2 vaccine viruses into an environment where there are unimmunized children risks igniting future outbreaks like this one. 
“Speed is relatively important but quality is going to be even more important,” Zaffran said. “We want to really interrupt the transmission, protect the population and ensure that we don’t seed more of these … [outbreaks]. So it’s going to be important to do it very properly.”

The Northwest Indiana Times reports Jacob Stanley graduated from Crown Point High School in December and joined the Marines. He completed boot camp last week and flew home for Tuesday's ceremony. 
School principal Chip Petit tells the newspaper tradition calls for all students to wear a cap and gown to graduation. He says individual students can recognize achievements such as military service by wearing stoles or chords over their gowns. 
He says the policy isn't ""intended to be disrespectful"" to students entering the military.

ROSEVILLE, Calif. -- What's being called a nationwide day of action against Muslims is expected to unfold across the country on Saturday, CBS Sacramento reports . 
In Roseville, "" Act for America "" -- a conservative, right-wing group that is known for spreading anti-Islamic messages -- has planned a march. 
The rally is expected to take place at the Fountains Shopping Center, but it's being met with opposition by another group. 
Members of "" Roseville Resistance "" -- a left-wing, grassroots group -- say they plan to counter-protest in a unity rally. 
Protests and counter-protests like these have turned viciously violent in years prior. In 2016, at the state Capitol, a massive riot broke out as alt-right and anti-fascist groups clashed. Ten people were stabbed and others injured . 
In April, more violence erupted at a Berkeley protest when a woman was punched in the face by a self-proclaimed white nationalist. 
According to Facebook event pages, members from anti-fascist group Antifa and the Bay Area Alt Right Movement, who have both been involved in violent protests before, plan to attend Saturday's gatherings. 
Roseville Police say they're prepared should things go south. 
""We're making plans for a number of different scenarios,"" said Roseville Police Department Public Information Officer Dee Dee Gunther. ""Of course, we're just hoping that people will express themselves peacefully and go home.""

An influential conservative lawmaker says Republicans controlling the House are simply stuck and are unable to pass a party budget . 
Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who helped to establish the House Freedom Caucus, is reminding an audience of conservatives that Republicans have to pass an overall budget blueprint before they can try to overhaul the tax code, a GOP priority. 
Jordan told a Heritage Foundation forum that ""right now a budget cannot pass in the House of Representatives. It can't."" 
Under Washington's convoluted budget process, Congress passes an overall budget plan that sets goals for follow-up spending. 
Jordan said House Republicans are split into three camps on spending, including defense hawks, defenders of domestic programs, and conservatives such as himself who want to cut domestic agencies. © 2017 The Associated Press.

Life is busy. And let's face it — who doesn't struggle with fitting work, play, working out, eating right, volunteering, detox-time and the gazillion other things we want to do in any given 24-hour day? But the evidence shows that if you're one of the one in three Americans who steals time from the seven to nine hours of sleep adults should be clocking, you're not doing yourself or your health any favors. 
Studies have shown that cutting your sleep short for even just one night directly affects the levels of the hormones that control appetite (causing you to feel hungrier), makes you more likely to have an accident driving and on the job , leaves you less focused , makes you less able to control your emotions (and more likely to overreact emotionally in a situation), makes you more likely to catch a cold and may actually damage brain tissue . 
And over time, being chronically sleep deprived (or having a disrupted sleep schedule) has been linked to a higher risk of stroke , some cancers , diabetes, heart disease, being obese and dying younger from any cause. 
More from NBC News: What millennial women want (and the squad that helps them get it) 
Not getting enough sleep or getting poor quality sleep is associated with a lot of negative outcomes, Phyllis Zee , MD, PhD, Chief of Sleep Medicine in the Department of Neurology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, told NBC News BETTER. The bottom line, she says: ""If you want to enjoy healthy aging get sufficient sleep and at the right time."" 
For most people getting enough sleep means turning in earlier at night. From a physiological standpoint, sleep quality is better in a darker environment and the morning daylight helps keep our body clocks run on time (and thus enhances sleep quality), Zee says. Plus — most people have fairly inflexible times we need to get up for work or school, she says. ""So, it's not much of a choice other than [being] chronically sleep-deprived.' 
So, this week, challenge yourself to get to bed a full hour earlier than usual. Here are some tips for beating whatever it is that's getting in the way of your shuteye. NBC | Getty Images If you can't stop scrolling through your Facebook feed 
You try turning in a full hour earlier than usual, hit the lights, quickly set the alarm on your phone (eight full hours from now!) and decide to quickly check if anyone else has commented on that great photo of your puppy you posted before dinner… And two hours later you find yourself scrolling through all 650-plus photos of your high school crush's tacky wedding. 
""Staying 'plugged in' keeps the brain in daytime/work mode,"" says Janet Kennedy, PhD, a clinical psychologist, founder of NYC Sleep Doctor and author of ""The Good Sleeper: The Essential Guide to Sleep for Your Baby (and You)."" The brain needs a period of time between daytime activity and sleep as a buffer zone, she says. ""Otherwise the brain has to calm down once you're in bed — and that leads to racing thoughts and poor sleep quality."" 
Plus, screen time before bedtime (or more specifically the blue light that screens give off) actually suppresses the body's production of melatonin, the hormone that helps your body drift to dreamland, and has been linked to worse sleep quality . 
Zee suggests leaving time after dinner for any email — or Facebook -checking you plan to do for the night — before you brush your teeth, she says. And prioritize, she says — don't reply to anything that isn't urgent. (Dimming your screen's light or filtering out the blue light can help, too, she added.) If eating dinner is the last think you do 
Italians know how to do food and wine — but their late dining schedule is not going to help with a healthy sleep schedule. Foods that are heavy, fatty, fried or spicy are tougher for the body to digest and can make it harder to sleep shortly after consuming. Late dining is also linked to changes in metabolism that can lead to weight gain, Zee says (that's not the case though in some instances, such as people who are getting a lot of physical activity and for people who consume healthy pre-bed snacks). 
Aim to stop eating at least three hours before you hit your pillow, Zee recommends. And if you do get hungry after dinner, pick a light snack with tryptophan (an amino acid known to potentially make you drowsy), such as a banana or warm milk, Zee says. Or pick a healthy snack that combines protein and carbs to satisfy your hunger and keep you full throughout the night . If your typical evening includes a twilight workout 
Regular exercise is linked to myriad mental and general health benefits — and has been linked to improved sleep quality , too (in terms of how long it takes you to fall asleep, how much deep sleep you get and how long you sleep in total). But too much activity too close to bedtime may stimulate the body and increase body temperature, making it tougher to fall asleep, Zee says. 
If you're working out in the evening, try non-strenuous anaerobic exercise — think yoga , walking or light weight lifting — which can help you relax in the evening. For some groups of people, those activities have been shown to make it easier to fall sleep, Zee says. And keep in mind that people's body physiology varies , so if you're a post-dinner jogger and you sleep like a baby, no reason to ditch your trainers. show chapters Friday, 20 Jan 2017 | 11:25 AM ET | 01:12 If your mind starts racing the moment you hit the pillow 
Your eyes are drooping, your body is heavy, but when your head makes contact with your pillow, your mind starts running like it's in the Olympic trials. Get out of bed and do something else to distract yourself and make you sleepy , Kennedy, says. ""You want to maintain your bed as a happy and restful place."" 
Try reading fiction to get your mind off whatever's monopolizing your thoughts, she says. Other fixes: the National Sleep Foundation recommends sipping chamomile tea, meditating , taking a hot shower or designating a specific time of the day (that's not right before bed) to worry about the things that are stressing you out to help you relax, so you can easily nod off when it's time to sleep. If happy hour lasts all night 
A drink (or a few) in the evening may make it easier to nod off initially, but it can wreak havoc on the quality of your sleep you're getting. Research that monitored brain activity in individuals who drank alcohol within an hour of sleep , show that it sends the brain quickly into deep sleep — but there's a rebound effect in the second half of the night where the brain's not getting adequate deep, restorative sleep it needs. 
No need to skip the nightcap altogether — but do enjoy it in moderation. Data suggests that a blood alcohol concentration of 0.03 may be low enough to not disturb your sleep . (That's between one and two drinks , depending on your gender, weight and how fast you're drinking.) And avoid using alcohol as a sleep aid , according to the National Sleep Foundation. If you cannot stop hitting the snooze 
Yep, this morning habit is a sneaky and notorious sleep sabateur. Those ""precious"" extra minutes of sleep you're getting are light and poor quality, Kennedy explained. The bottom line: they'll actually leave you feeling groggier when you do get up. And the later you do finally get out of bed, the harder it'll be to fall asleep when it comes time to turn in that evening, she says. If you're an extreme night owl 
Sleep experts suspect that most people have a combination of ""night owl"" and ""early bird"" tendencies — which can be dictated in a big way by our environment, age and surroundings. But there's also a small percentage of people whose brains have a specific architecture that causes them to be extremely late sleepers and risers or extreme early risers and sleepers. (The prevalence for people with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder is thought to affect 0.1 to three percent of the general population and is more common in adolescents and young adults.) 
If your body clock feels slightly off when you want to get up in the morning or call it quits at night, give your body the physiological cues it needs to sleep, Zee says. Avoid light in the evening and eating late — and get out into the sunlight (or other bright light) in the morning and keep your sleep-wake schedule consistent, she says. And if that still doesn't help, a sleep specialist can prescribe various regimens of timed light therapy, physical activity and melatonin to help better align an individual's body clock with their work and social schedule, Zee added.

Standing outside 10 Downing St. today, Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May tried to put a brave face on the disastrous results of Thursday's vote. Theresa May Promises 'Certainty' After Queen Approves Plan To Form Government 
After calling a snap election in April in anticipation of a landslide, she ended up with an electoral train wreck, in which her Conservative Party actually lost its parliamentary majority. It now holds 318 seats. 
Clinging to power, May said the Tories would form a minority government with the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, which won 10 seats. 
""What the country needs more than ever is certainty,"" she said.

Now, though, the political landscape of the United Kingdom and the country's path toward leaving the European Union seem more unclear than ever. 
Front and center among many questions facing May's new government is the matter of Brexit. Negotiations with the EU are scheduled to begin later this month. 
""The irony of this is that Theresa May is calling this a certainty government and talking about how it's delivering certainty,"" said Brian Klaas, a fellow in comparative politics at the London School of Economics. ""I think the only thing that political commentators can agree on is that we have uncertainty right now and nobody has any clue what shape this negotiation is going to take."" 
May has been pressing for a so-called ""hard"" Brexit, which would include leaving the EU's massive collective market and no longer allowing EU citizens to come and live and work freely in the United Kingdom. Some members of Parliament in May's Tory party and the rival Labour Party favor a softer Brexit, in which the U.K. might maintain a much closer relationship with the EU. A Man With A Bucket On His Head Ran To Unseat Theresa May. Why? Well ... 
Analysts say May's electoral debacle could reopen what had seemed largely a closed debate — both with pro-EU members of Parliament trying to take advantage of the prime minister's weakness and Euro-skeptic government ministers threatening her if she dares water down a Brexit deal. 
""Everybody is positioning themselves,"" said Anand Menon , professor of European politics and foreign affairs at Kings College London. ""Remember, both parties are divided."" It's hard to predict how they'll react, he says.

For instance, Menon said, some pro-EU Conservative legislators may wait until the Brexit legislative program comes to Parliament to start attacking it. 
""I think the Conservative party as a whole is reluctant to get rid of Theresa May now because it would mean a leadership election, it would mean stalling on Brexit talks,"" Menon said. ""But at the same time, she's very, very weak. So whether they can hold a weak leader in place — tactically, as it were — until they are ready to move, I don't know."" 
In Brussels, home of the EU, there was a mix of puzzlement, confusion and frustration over the chaos of British politics. 
Donald Tusk, president of the European Commission, urged the May government to get on with negotiations, noting that the U.K. has less than two years to extricate itself from the EU — which is considered a gargantuan task. 
""We don't know when Brexit talks start,"" Tusk tweeted . But ""we know when they must end. Do your best to avoid a 'no deal' as result of 'no negotiations.'"" 
Given May's diminished state, many in the European Union are wondering how long she will be leading the country and – by extension – guiding the Brexit negotiations. 
""How do you negotiate when you know that the position of the partner that you're negotiating with is extremely weak?"" says Klaas of the London School of Economics. 
Some in Brussels may see this as an opportunity to drive a hard deal and dictate terms, Klass believes, while others may worry a weak prime minister won't be able to get parliamentary approval for a tough deal. 
If all this uncertainty weren't enough, the Labour Party, which won 261 seats in the election, has its own divisions to deal with. And the relationship between the Conservatives and its minority government partner, the Democratic Unionist Party, also remains unclear. 
The DUP is skeptical of Europe and is pro-Brexit. But it is also deeply worried that splitting from the EU will mean a return to a hard border across Ireland that could create economic and even political problems. 
With the DUP providing the Conservatives a narrow, but crucial, majority in Parliament, it could have an outsized influence. 
At a press conference today, DUP leader Arlene Foster was vague about a working relationship with May's Conservatives. 
""The prime minister has spoken with me this morning,"" Foster said. ""We will enter discussions with the Conservatives to explore how it may be possible to bring stability to our nation at this time of great challenge.""","After U.K. Election, The Only 'Certainty' In Britain Is Uncertainty",normal,339a8d24bcc81ed086e447ec20c813f14f452035

By Gail Godwin. Bloomsbury; 324 pages; $26. To be published in Britain in August, £18.99.
OUT with the clichés of cold draughts and creaking doors. Contemporary novelists are refocusing the ghost story, revelling in its potential for psychological drama. “Grief Cottage” by Gail Godwin, a prolific American writer, is a quiet, hopeful ghost story—a wistful reflection on loss, loneliness, coming of age and coming to terms with the past.
 2 11 Marcus, the narrator, is 11 years old when his mother is killed in a car accident. He is sent to live on a small island in South Carolina with his great aunt, a reclusive painter. A precocious, imaginative boy, he worries constantly about how his words and actions affect others.
Desperate not to burden his new guardian, he spends much of his time outdoors, finding himself drawn to a derelict house known as Grief Cottage because of a hurricane half a century earlier during which a teenage boy and his parents went missing. They are presumed to have been swept out to sea. One day Marcus sees a boy with a “flat unsmiling mouth” and “hungry dark pools” for eyes. He is both repelled and attracted by this apparition. Struggling to deal with his losses, Marcus believes the boy “had been waiting all this time…for someone to wonder where he was—to miss him after he was gone”.
But “Grief Cottage” is no ordinary haunted-house tale. Marcus’s relationship with the boy is at the heart of the novel, yet peripheral to its action. Marcus spends most of his time looking after his aunt, who is haunted by demons of her own. He also watches over a nest site of turtles’ eggs, so that he can help them reach the sea once they hatch. When the weather is bad, he slowly works his way through the boxes of belongings packaged up after his mother’s death and shipped to his aunt’s house, sorting through all of their shared possessions and the memories they dredge up.
Ms Godwin’s vivid prose ensures that these mundane activities are just as compelling as his encounters with the supernatural. The author, who turns 80 this month, never forgets that “there are enough horrors in the real world to worry about”, as Marcus’s aunt puts it, when the boy finds himself grappling with “awful things I didn’t want inside me”.
Like Joanna Briscoe’s “Touched” and Sarah Waters’s “The Little Stranger”, “Grief Cottage” is an ambiguous, beguiling tale in which the presence of the supernatural is entangled with—and perhaps precipitated by—characters who are undergoing an emotional crisis. Ms Godwin’s interest lies not with the dead but with the living, and how they learn to lay their ghosts to rest.

But as far as Causality goes, it was in deep trouble, even within a purely classical realm. Aristotle had no framework or ability to deal with coupled systems, such as systems of coupled differential equations, so he focussed on ideas of Cause, proximal or dominant or prime or other.
But in systems having components which interact, the overall behavior of the system or often even that of a component does not have a clearly defined cause. The deer + predators + deer forage system can collapse if predators are independently hunted, because the deer populations bloom and they exhaust forage, causing their populations to die of starvation and disease, and offering no solace for their predators.
One observes this confusion when science deniers try to use strict time sequencing to assign causality in paleoclimate series, arguing that CO2 increases came after initial warming so they could not be the cause. No, to the contrary, this is another example of such a coupled system.

Comparing the genomes of modern humans with those from fossils of Neanderthals ( Homo neanderthalensis ) suggests that the lines leading to these two species split from one another more than 500,000 years ago. But that does not answer the question of when they achieved their distinctive forms.
Fossils recognisable as Neanderthals go back 250,000 years, about halfway between the present day and the time of their common ancestor with Homo sapiens , a member of a species called Homo heidelbergensis . Several sites older than 250,000 years and containing fossils intermediate in form between heidelbergensis and neanderthalensis are known, making 250,000 years a reasonably definitive date.
 3 hours ago Poland’s 7 8 12 Until now, however, the most ancient bones universally agreed to have belonged to Homo sapiens have dated back only 195,000 years. And fossils intermediate in form between sapiens and heidelbergensis are scarce. How quickly the relevant branch of Homo heidelbergensis turned into something that could be called Homo sapiens was therefore obscure. But work led by researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, in Leipzig, Germany, which has just been published in Nature , has shed some light. The remains of at least five individuals, collected from a site called Jebel Irhoud, in Morocco, look like modern humans and seem to date back 300,000 years. That not only makes them the oldest Homo sapiens found so far (and shows that sapiens is actually an older species than neanderthalensis ). It also demonstrates that sapiens was far more widespread than researchers had suspected, for previous early fossils of the species have come exclusively from eastern and southern Africa.
The fossils themselves are described by a group led by Jean-Jacques Hublin. They include a cranium, a lower jaw bone, an upper jaw, and various other skull fragments and teeth. Adding these together and filling in the blanks yields a model of the creature’s skull (pictured), and comparing this with other fossils, some definitively identified as Homo sapiens and some equally definitively identified as not, shows that the parts from which it is composed come from a sapiens population.
The likely age of this population was worked out by Dr Hublin’s colleague Daniel Richter and his team (of which Dr Hublin was also a member). They used a technique called thermoluminescence to date stone tools found in the same stratum as the fossils. They also re-dated a tooth that had been found in a badly recorded excavation carried out on the same site in the 1960s. This tooth had been thought to be 160,000 years old, and thus not of such great interest. However, both tools and tooth proved, within the margins of error of the techniques involved, to be about 300,000 years old.

Andrew Milligan/AP Standing outside 10 Downing St. today, Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May tried to put a brave face on the disastrous results of Thursday's vote.
The Two-Way Theresa May Promises 'Certainty' After Queen Approves Plan To Form Government After calling a snap election in April in anticipation of a landslide, she ended up with an electoral train wreck, in which her Conservative Party actually lost its parliamentary majority. It now holds 318 seats.
Clinging to power, May said the Tories would form a minority government with the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, which won 10 seats.
""What the country needs more than ever is certainty,"" she said.

toggle caption Tim Ireland/AP British Prime Minister Theresa May speaks next to her husband Philip in London Friday. May's gamble in calling an early election backfired, as her Conservative Party lost its majority in Parliament.
Tim Ireland/AP Now, though, the political landscape of the United Kingdom and the country's path toward leaving the European Union seem more unclear than ever.
Front and center among many questions facing May's new government is the matter of Brexit. Negotiations with the EU are scheduled to begin later this month.
""The irony of this is that Theresa May is calling this a certainty government and talking about how it's delivering certainty,"" said Brian Klaas, a fellow in comparative politics at the London School of Economics. ""I think the only thing that political commentators can agree on is that we have uncertainty right now and nobody has any clue what shape this negotiation is going to take.""
May has been pressing for a so-called ""hard"" Brexit, which would include leaving the EU's massive collective market and no longer allowing EU citizens to come and live and work freely in the United Kingdom. Some members of Parliament in May's Tory party and the rival Labour Party favor a softer Brexit, in which the U.K. might maintain a much closer relationship with the EU.
The Two-Way A Man With A Bucket On His Head Ran To Unseat Theresa May. Why? Well ... Analysts say May's electoral debacle could reopen what had seemed largely a closed debate — both with pro-EU members of Parliament trying to take advantage of the prime minister's weakness and Euro-skeptic government ministers threatening her if she dares water down a Brexit deal.
""Everybody is positioning themselves,"" said Anand Menon , professor of European politics and foreign affairs at Kings College London. ""Remember, both parties are divided."" It's hard to predict how they'll react, he says.

Peter Morrison/AP For instance, Menon said, some pro-EU Conservative legislators may wait until the Brexit legislative program comes to Parliament to start attacking it.
""I think the Conservative party as a whole is reluctant to get rid of Theresa May now because it would mean a leadership election, it would mean stalling on Brexit talks,"" Menon said. ""But at the same time, she's very, very weak. So whether they can hold a weak leader in place — tactically, as it were — until they are ready to move, I don't know.""
In Brussels, home of the EU, there was a mix of puzzlement, confusion and frustration over the chaos of British politics.
Donald Tusk, president of the European Commission, urged the May government to get on with negotiations, noting that the U.K. has less than two years to extricate itself from the EU — which is considered a gargantuan task.
""We don't know when Brexit talks start,"" Tusk tweeted . But ""we know when they must end. Do your best to avoid a 'no deal' as result of 'no negotiations.'""
Given May's diminished state, many in the European Union are wondering how long she will be leading the country and – by extension – guiding the Brexit negotiations.
""How do you negotiate when you know that the position of the partner that you're negotiating with is extremely weak?"" says Klaas of the London School of Economics.
Some in Brussels may see this as an opportunity to drive a hard deal and dictate terms, Klass believes, while others may worry a weak prime minister won't be able to get parliamentary approval for a tough deal.
If all this uncertainty weren't enough, the Labour Party, which won 261 seats in the election, has its own divisions to deal with. And the relationship between the Conservatives and its minority government partner, the Democratic Unionist Party, also remains unclear.
The DUP is skeptical of Europe and is pro-Brexit. But it is also deeply worried that splitting from the EU will mean a return to a hard border across Ireland that could create economic and even political problems.
With the DUP providing the Conservatives a narrow, but crucial, majority in Parliament, it could have an outsized influence.
At a press conference today, DUP leader Arlene Foster was vague about a working relationship with May's Conservatives.
""The prime minister has spoken with me this morning,"" Foster said. ""We will enter discussions with the Conservatives to explore how it may be possible to bring stability to our nation at this time of great challenge.""","After U.K. Election, The Only 'Certainty' In Britain Is Uncertainty : Parallels : NPR",normal,339a8d24bcc81ed086e447ec20c813f14f452035

Country music lost one of its most well-known collaborators yesterday. Norris Wilson — whom most just called ""Norro"" — was a singer, songwriter and producer capable of taking on pretty much any job in the Nashville music scene that needed doing. He died Thursday at age 79. Sometimes, when you're writing a song, all you really need is a solid lick, or guitar phrase. That's what happened in the first hit song that Wilson co-wrote — ""Baby Baby,"" performed by David Houston in 1969. YouTube 
""I had this little guitar lick, and it felt good, and we got together and cranked that song up. And hey, it worked,"" Wilson told the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001, for a series focused on major contributors to country music they called ""Poets And Prophets."" 
And if Wilson sounds like he's underselling the difficulty of songwriting in that quote — well, he's humble like that throughout the whole interview, always making sure to give props where props are due. 
Wilson was a consummate collaborator — he could work on his own, he simply preferred not to. ""I always really, really enjoyed co-writing,"" he said in the Country Music Hall of Fame interview. ""I think I had enough talent to write by myself. I did write a couple of things by myself. I just didn't love doing that, and consequently you try other things.""Norro Wilson was born on April 4, 1938, in Kentucky. His dad was a barber; his mom was a factory worker. He tried a bunch of different things growing up, like playing piano as a kid and singing in a barbershop quartet in high school. In college, he joined a gospel singing group, which influenced his later songwriting. YouTube 
""I never got tired of singing gospel,"" Wilson said. ""That was just very special, especially as a group. And so harmonies always had a lot to do with my music world."" 
Some of Wilson's hit singles include Tammy Wynette's ""He Loves Me All The Way"" and George Jones' ""A Picture Of Me (Without You)."" In 1975, he won a Grammy for Charlie Rich's ""A Very Special Love Song."" While the late '60s to mid-'70s were probably Norro Wilson's most fertile period, he was also prolific into the 2000s, working with artists like Kenny Chesney, Shania Twain and Reba McEntire. 
And this is just stuff Wilson did that you can hear on the radio. He was also a talent scout, a song plugger, a mentor — an overall steward of country music. 
""Norro Wilson was one of the great music men, not just of our time, but all time,"" Chesney told The Tennessean yesterday. ""He taught me so much about soul, and songs, and what it means to touch someone's life with music."" ",Remembering Country Music Hitmaker Norro Wilson,normal,3b453aacccb147487845f6b5240812e6eb6ddb6a

Robert Hood/Fred Hutch News Service 
If you were worried you had cancer, who would you call for information? Chances are a federally-funded cancer helpline isn't the first place that pops into your mind. 
But for 40 years, a helpline funded primarily by the National Cancer Institute has been answering people's questions about cancer. 
It's a source of information for people who have been called back for a follow-up after routine screenings and are worried they might have cancer. And it can also help cancer patients get information about participating in clinical trials and help them figure out questions to ask their doctors. 
The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle runs the Contact Center , which is funded mostly by the National Cancer Institute with some support from the Veteran's Administration. Last month, the NCI awarded Fred Hutch a $24 million, three-year contract to continue operating the helpline. 
""There will be about 1.7 million Americans diagnosed with cancer this year. For many of them, access to good information can be the difference between life and death,"" says Peter Garrett, a spokesperson for the National Cancer Institute. 
More than 91,000 people reached out to the Contact Center via phone, email or social media in 2016 — a total of about 250 inquiries per day. This year, more people have been contacting the center through a live chat, email or social media than with a phone call, says the center's director, Nancy Gore. 
""Over the years, call volume has declined although the complexity of the calls has increased,"" says Gore. ""People seek information via the Internet, so [they] can often find answers to basic questions such as general cancer symptoms, a common call before the Internet became pervasive."" 
Now, people more often need technical information about clinical trials and gene therapies, she says. 
But the helpline remains relatively little-known by the general public. About 10 percent of those inquiries were from repeat clients, according to data provided by the center. 
Back in the 1980s, more than 20 cancer call centers operated around the country. Now there's just one. 
Assuming that the cancer center spends about $8 million this year to handle a similar number of inquiries, by our very rough calculation that adds up to a cost of about $87.14 per inquiry. 
There's no limit on the amount of time a helpline staffer can spend on the phone with a client. Eric Suni, a cancer information specialist at the center, says he has occasionally spent more than an hour on the phone with a caller during the seven years he's worked there. 
""Sometimes people will call and say they have one quick question, but answering that one quick question requires a much more in-depth discussion because you can only answer that question by explaining some other concept,"" Suni says. ""Even those that seem like, oh, this should take two minutes to answer is actually a much more involved conversation. So you never really know until it actually starts to unfold."" 
Hotline staffers, who are required to have a four-year college degree, spend six to seven weeks in initial training. The center calls this process ""the metamorphosis from civilian into a Cancer Information Specialist,"" in a training overview document. 
It's hard not to think that the call center had become less necessary in an era when people can Google symptoms and get advice in patient groups on Facebook, but Gore says there's still a need. 
""In fact, it is such a common, common comment that is shared with us that they [the clients] wish they had known we were here when they were first diagnosed, or when their mother was diagnosed,"" Gore says. 
Gore's husband died of melanoma when he was 34. She didn't know much about his disease at the time of his diagnosis, she says. 
""Until a cancer diagnosis is part of someone's family or close friend situation people are aware of it, but until it hits home you're not that in tune to it,"" Gore says. ""Once it actually hits home, then people have intense interest and a thirst for knowledge because they want to understand."" 
Doctors may explain information to patients, but sometimes the shock of a cancer diagnosis can make it tough for a patient to focus. 
""For most people, you don't hear anything after the diagnosis. You're just processing the words,"" Gore says. 
The NCI estimates that about 4 in 10 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, according to data from 2010 to 2012. 
Callers to the hotline ask most frequently about breast cancer, according to 2016 data, followed by other more common cancers including lung and prostate. 
And more people called with questions about a spouse, friend or relative than about themselves. 
The people who reach out to the center in English tend to be in their 50, 60s and 70s, but those who seek a conversation in Spanish are generally younger – most are in their 30s, 40s or 50s. 
Other sources of information about cancer also exist, such as a 24-hour hotline run by the American Cancer Society, which received about 744,000 inquiries last year. 
Dr. Deanna Attai, a clinical professor of surgery at the University of California Los Angeles, participates in the weekly Breast Cancer Social Media chats known as #bcsm. She says she got involved after she noticed a Twitter conversation where a breast cancer patient was asking for treatment advice. Attai started a private conversation with the patient, offering her advice about reliable surgeons. 
She calls it her Twitter ""ah-ha"" moment. 
""Just by stumbling across a conversation in the middle of the night, you could really have a big impact,"" Attai says. ""That was for me, when I started to realize where my voice is among the community, that I could act as kind of like a guide."" 
Attai doesn't see social media making the NCI Contact Center obsolete. Instead, the cancer institute could use social media to point people to the NCI as a source of up-to-date, unbiased information. 
""I think they should be using social media to promote themselves,"" Attai says. ""People don't really understand what the NCI does, unless you're a researcher or physician or maybe someone that's participated in a clinical trial.""",Got Cancer Questions?

LOS ANGELES -- Roman Polanski's sexual assault victim asked a judge Friday to end the 40-year-old case against the fugitive director, but there was no indication her plea would have any effect. 
Samantha Geimer told Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon that she wanted the case to end, either with an outright dismissal or by the judge sentencing Polanski without him being present. Polanski's repeated requests for the same rulings have been denied. Roman Polanski no longer presiding over France's César Awards after backlash 
Gordon said he would take Geimer's comments into consideration and did not issue an immediate ruling. 
""I'm standing here saying he's served his sentence,"" Geimer said after the hearing. ""He owes me nothing. He owes the state of California nothing except to show up here eventually. I wish he could show up and feel he could be treated fairly, but I don't know if that will ever happen."" 
Geimer said before she addressed the court that she was terrified but felt compelled to tell Gordon her thoughts on the case. A Los Angeles judge on Monday rejected Roman Polanski's bid to end his long-running underage sex abuse case without the fugitive director appeari... 
""This may be my last chance,"" she said. ""I finally will get to stand before a judge and say how I feel, so I thought I should take it."" 
Geimer has long supported Polanski's efforts to end the legal saga that limits his freedom, but Friday was the first time she's appeared in court on his behalf, attorney Harland Braun said. 
""She's tired of this case,"" Braun said Thursday. ""The judge is just playing games with him."" Polish court: Law forbids extradition of Roman Polanski 
The Oscar-winner has been a fugitive since he fled to France in 1978 on the eve of sentencing for having unlawful sex with a minor. Prosecutors dropped charges that he drugged, raped and sodomized Geimer when she was 13 years old. 
Polanski feared the judge was going to renege on a plea agreement and send him away for more time than the six weeks he served in prison during a psychiatric evaluation prior to sentencing. His lawyers have been fighting for years to end the case and lift an international arrest warrant that confined him to his native France, Switzerland and Poland, where he fled the Holocaust. 
Polanski contends he is the victim of judicial misconduct because the now-deceased judge who handled the case suggested in private remarks that he would not honor a plea agreement. 
Geimer has previously said she forgives Polanski for the assault that happened at Jack Nicholson's compound in the Hollywood Hills during a March 1977 photo shoot. She wrote a memoir titled ""The Girl: A Life in the Shadow of Roman Polanski"" four years ago. The cover features a photo shot by Polanski. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

President Trump on Friday accused fired FBI Director James Comey of making untrue statements in his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee Thursday, but also said he felt vindicated by other parts of Comey's testimony.
Mr. Trump, in a joint news conference in the White House Rose Garden with Romanian president Klaus Iohannis, said some of Comey's testimony -- such as Comey's recollection of conversations with the president in which Mr. Trump urged him to drop an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn -- were untrue. The president, in his first press conference since Comey's testimony, called Comey a ""leaker,"" but stopped short of calling him a liar. But, at the same time, the president said other parts of Mr. Comey's testimony confirmed what Mr. Trump had already said, such as that he wasn't under criminal investigation.
Mr. Trump said he would ""100 percent"" be willing to testify under oath and speak with Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor in the FBI's investigation into Russian election meddling and any ties between Russia and the Trump campaign.
Mr. Trump dodged multiple questions about whether there are tapes of his conversations with Comey. Mr. Trump first brought up the possibility of tapes in a tweet shortly after firing Comey, saying the ousted FBI director, ""better hope that there are no 'tapes'"" of their conversations.
The president said he would let the media know whether there are tapes in the ""very near future,"" adding that people will be ""very disappointed"" when they hear the answer to that question.
Comey on Thursday said he hopes such tapes do exist .
""Lordy, I hope there are tapes,"" he told the committee.
For weeks, the White House has hedged on questions from the press about whether such tapes exist, and whether Mr. Trump regularly records conversations in the White House.
The president again reiterated that he never told Comey to drop the investigation into Flynn. But Mr. Trump also said that, if he had, there would be nothing wrong with that, according to what he had been reading.
Mr. Trump's personal lawyer is planning to file a complaint against Comey with the Senate Judiciary Committee and Department of Justice Office of Inspector General.
Mr. Trump drew attention for some of his comments on foreign policy issues as well.
Mr. Trump said he is ""committing"" the U.S. to Article 5 in NATO, which provides that all NATO allies consider an armed attack on one of its members to be an act of violence worthy of aid. But, asked by a foreign reporter whether he views Russia to be a threat like many neighboring NATO allies do, Mr. Trump failed to answer.
The president also lashed out against Qatar -- moments after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called on Saudi Arabia and Egypt to ease a blockage on Qatar -- creating a seemingly inconsistent message within the administration. Mr. Trump criticized Qatar for being a ""funder of terrorism at a very high level.""

The Chicago resident was on a rooftop across the street when he noticed thousands of people passing the man, who was holding a walking stick and waving his hand in an attempt to stop a taxi. 
Not one car stopped -- but luckily, a pedestrian did.
Casey Spelman, of Indianapolis, was visiting friends in the area and spotted the blind man, who was identified as Yusef Dale , an assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago, as she walked out of a Wrigleyville restaurant. Without a word, Spelman split from her friends, walked over to Dale and tapped him on the shoulder.
""Do you want some help getting a cab?"" Spelman asked.
""He said, 'Yeah, you sound pretty, so cabs will probably stop for you before me,'"" Spelman recalled Dale joking.
They chatted about baseball and how crowded the area was after a Saturday afternoon game as Spelman stepped out into the street to flag down a cab. Within minutes, a taxi pulled up and Spelman helped Dale inside, giving him a hug goodbye in the process.
""We laughed and exchanged goodbyes and went our separate ways,"" Spelman told CBS News.

""There was a blind Cubs fan trying to hail a cab for several minutes until the lady came up and asked him if he needed help hailing a cab. She stood there with him until one pulled up,"" Hamilton wrote in the post that has since gone viral with nearly 8,000 shares. ""Awesome to see such kindness in a world.""
The next day, Spelman was surprised to see photos of herself and Dale online.

Hundreds of people commented on Hamilton's post, thanking Spelman for stopping.

""As a person who is legally blind and in a wheelchair myself, God bless you,"" another commented. ""It's not as easy as one thinks asking for help or hailing a taxi.""
Spelman is glad her post is inspiring others and hopes others will step outside of their comfort zones if they encounter a similar situation.

The prosecution called 12 witnesses over five brisk days of testimony in the sexual assault case that could send the 79-year-old TV star to prison for the rest of his life. The defense will begin presenting its side on Monday.
Testifying under oath in 2005, Cosby said he obtained several prescriptions for quaaludes in the 1970s and offered the now-banned sedatives to others, ""the same as a person would say, 'Have a drink,'"" according to the deposition read to the jury.
""When you got the quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these quaaludes for young women that you wanted to have sex with?"" the comic once known as America's Dad was asked.
""Yes,"" he said.

Cosby is on trial on charges he drugged and sexually violated former Temple University women's basketball team employee Andrea Costand, now 44, at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004. He has said it was consensual.
In the deposition, which became public nearly two years ago, Cosby said he gave Constand three half-tablets of the cold and allergy medicine Benadryl. Prosecutors have suggested he gave her something stronger - perhaps quaaludes, a highly popular party drug in the 1970s that was banned in the U.S. in 1982.
Prosecutors evidently saved the quaalude testimony until the end for maximum effect. Defense lawyer Brian McMonagle, clearly wanting to move past Cosby's talk about giving drugs to women, asked no questions about it on cross-examination.
The final prosecution witness, toxicologist Dr. Timothy Rohrig, testified that wooziness and other effects Constand described could have been caused by Benadryl or quaaludes.
Cosby smiled as he walked out of court at the end of the day, raising his wooden cane to salute well-wishers who yelled, ""We love you, Bill Cosby!"" and ""Hey, hey, hey!,"" the catchphrase from his ""Fat Albert"" TV show. He then waved from the back of an SUV.
The comedian gave the deposition as part of a lawsuit filed by Constand and later settled for an undisclosed sum. His testimony was sealed for years until portions were released by a judge in 2015 at the request of The Associated Press.
Play Video CBS Evening News Cosby accuser stands by her story Andrea Constand, the woman at the center of Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial, stood by her story Wednesday. But she admitted she made a mistake....
The release of the sensational testimony spurred Pennsylvania prosecutors to reopen their investigation and arrest Cosby a decade after the district attorney who originally investigated Constand's complaint decided the case was too weak to bring charges.
For the jury, the deposition could be the closest it comes to hearing from Cosby himself, since he said recently that he did not intend to take the stand.
In his testimony, Cosby said he apologized to Constand's mother over the telephone for the sexual encounter with her daughter because he was afraid she thought of him as ""a dirty old man.""
""I apologized to this woman. But my apology was, my God, I'm in trouble with these people because this is an old man and their young daughter and the mother sees this,"" he said.
Cosby also recounted offering to pay for graduate school for Constand. She turned him down.
Hoping to blunt one of Cosby's main lines of defense, prosecutors put on the stand a psychologist who testified that victims of celebrities are often afraid to come forward because of the possible backlash. Constand did not go to police until a year after the alleged assault.
""If it's a well-known person, the victim takes on a lot of responsibility for that person's reputation, especially if that person is well-liked or beloved,"" Veronique Valliere testified.
Andrea Constand arrives during Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pa., on Wed., June 7, 2017. Cosby is accused of drugging and sexually assaulting Constand at his home outside Philadelphia in 2004.
AP Cosby's lawyers asked for a mistrial, complaining that Valliere was offering observations about Cosby even though she was only allowed to testify generally about victim behavior. The judge rejected the request.
In a barrage that all but destroyed Cosby's good-guy reputation, some 60 women have come forward to say he sexually violated them, but the statute of limitations for prosecution had run out in nearly every case. Constand is the only woman whose allegations have resulted in criminal charges against the ""Cosby Show"" star.
During a break Friday, Cosby's spokesman dangled the possibility the comic might testify after all. Cosby and his lawyer wouldn't comment on that, and the defense has not disclosed its strategy or the witnesses it intends to call during its portion of the case.
Testifying would carry enormous risk for Cosby, exposing him to cross-examination about some of the lurid things in his deposition.
Cosby's wife, Camille, has yet to be seen in court. Cosby spokesman Andrew Wyatt said the TV star told her stay away so that she wouldn't have to endure the ""media circus.""",Bill Cosby trial: Prosecutors present 2005 quaaludes testimony and rest case - CBS News,normal,533b1a3a258ac173af55c837827a2a84aa28864f

DETROIT -- A Detroit man is charged in the fatal shooting of a 17-year-old boy who was trying to sell a pair of Nike Air Jordan sneakers. 
Prosecutors say 19-year-old Dante Ford was arraigned Friday on murder, assault with intent to murder, armed robbery and gun charges. 
He's accused of killing Corey Harris-Thomas. The Grosse Pointe Woods teen had arranged to sell a pair of the shoes to Ford. Harris-Thomas and a 24-year-old friend picked up Ford Tuesday afternoon on Detroit's west side. 
Prosecutors say Harris-Thomas, his friend and Ford were shot inside the SUV. Harris-Thomas died at the scene. Ford ran away, but was arrested Wednesday. 
Ford is also charged with armed robbery after Air Jordan sneakers were taken earlier Tuesday from a 16-year-old boy who had arranged to sell a pair. 
The nearby Loyola High School was placed on lockdown as a precaution following the incident. Police said the victim was not a student and that the shooting was not connected to the school, CBS Detroit reports. 
A small crowd gathered at the scene of the shooting, CBS Detroit reports.

Special correspondent Malcolm Brabant reports.
MALCOLM BRABANT: It was a painful reckoning for a prime minister whose election gamble failed in a stunning fashion. But after meeting with the queen, Theresa May insisted she will carry on.
THERESA MAY , Prime Minister, United Kingdom: I will now form a government, a government that can provide certainty and lead Britain forward at this critical time for our country.
MALCOLM BRABANT: May had hoped the snap election would boost Conservative dominance in Parliament, and give her a stronger hand in negotiating Britain’s exit with the European Union. Instead, the Tories lost 13 seats in the House of Commons. The opposition Labor Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, gained 32 seats.
THERESA MAY: I had wanted to achieve a larger majority, but that wasn’t the result that we secured. And, as I reflect on the results, I will reflect on what we need to do in the future to take the party forward.
MALCOLM BRABANT: At Westminster, a demonstrator wearing a May mask laid flowers on a mock grave, amid rising calls for the prime minister to resign.
Labor leader Corbyn led the charge.
JEREMY CORBYN , Leader, Labour Party: It was her campaign, it was her decision to call the election, it was her name out there, and she was saying she was doing it to bring about strong and stable government. Well, this morning, it doesn’t look like a strong government, it doesn’t look like a stable government, it doesn’t look like a government that has any program whatsoever.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Corbyn’s success came in part from cooperating with the grassroots campaign normalization momentum, which took advice from Bernie Sanders’ volunteers.
Adam Klug is a national organizer.
ADAM KLUG , National Organizer, Momentum: You build up relationships with people on the doorstep. You listen to them. You communicate your ideas effectively and help train people on persuading people of why Labor’s policies made sense.
MALCOLM BRABANT: But May’s opponents aren’t the only ones questioning her role. Anna Soubry is a Conservative member of Parliament.
ANNA SOUBRY , Member of Parliament, Conservative Party: This is a very bad moment for the Conservative Party and we need to take stock, and our leader needs to take stock as well.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Will Conservatives go as far as removing May from power?
Anand Menon, a professor at King’s College London, says it depends on several key factors.
ANAND MENON , King’s College London: Firstly, the availability of someone else who can command support in the party, secondly, the scale of opposition in the party to her, and, thirdly, whether or not the members of the parliamentary party think it’s better to try and get rid of her now or have a period of calm where things can bed themselves in after the election, before maybe trying to do a leadership election next year.
MALCOLM BRABANT: May has been criticized for running a lackluster campaign. It was marked by a proposal to force elderly people to pay more for their care and her decision to skip a televised debate. Then came the terror attacks in Manchester and London, which refocused the race on security, and May’s role in cutting police ranks.
And there’s Brexit. The U.K.’s withdrawal talks with the E.U. are due to begin in just 10 days.
JOHN SPRINGFORD , Director of Research, Center for European Reform: This was certainly a rejection of Theresa May’s very tough Brexit strategy where she was going to cleave a lot of the links between the U.K. and the E.U.
MALCOLM BRABANT: John Springford is director of research at the Center for European Reform.
JOHN SPRINGFORD: There’s only about 18 months left to negotiate the Brexit deal, and if, say, we have another three or four months while the government is formed or we have fresh elections, then there’s much less time. And so the E.U. then has an awful lot of power towards the end of the negotiating process.
MALCOLM BRABANT: For now, May needs a coalition partner to form a governing majority in Parliament, most likely Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party. The group is pro-Brexit, but well to the right on social issues.
There’s broad agreement across the political spectrum that Theresa May is living on borrowed time. The Labor Party believes that her coalition of convenience with Northern Ireland’s DUP is unsustainable and that there will be a new general election in the not-too-distant future.
Mrs. May wants to remain in office for the next five years, but most analysts agree that the Conservative establishment will terminate her premiership when the time is right and they will select another candidate to lead them into the next general election — Judy.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Malcolm Brabant, in London.

In the 20th century, Oneida was a household name: One of America's biggest flatware manufacturers. The company's knives and forks were a symbol of middle-class elegance. The advertising was so prolific, Oneida came to represent the very idea of a well-set table. The company was as American as the rolling hills and open farmland of Sherrill, NY - near Oneida - where the flatware was made. 
But Oneida's past is far from ordinary. Before it became a company, Oneida was a commune that subscribed to an esoteric form of Christianity and practiced free love. The collective, share-and-share-alike values of the commune lingered on, and led to a different kind of company. It's a story of visionary radicals, astounding growth, and marketing genius. 
In a time where America's brand of go-it-alone, profit-or-bust capitalism is not working for everyone, the story of Oneida is a reminder that weirder worlds are possible, and a company based on unconventional communal values can thrive.

LONDON -- British police have arrested two more suspects over the London Bridge attack , and revealed that the carnage could have been worse had the attackers succeeded in their goal of renting a truck, rather than a van, to mow down pedestrians.
The bloodthirsty gang was also shot dead before they could make their way back to the van where their petrol bombs were stored.
London's Metropolitan Police said Saturday that they arrested a 27-year-old man and a 28-year-old man overnight in east London on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism. Police have seven people in custody over suspected links to the three attackers who killed eight people on and around London Bridge on June 3.
In a rare glimpse into the weeklong investigation, police released details on Saturday that showed Khuram Butt originally tried to rent a 7.5 ton truck. The intended truck was smaller but similar to the one used in the Nice attack last year that killed 86 people and injured hundreds in the resort town in the south of France.
After his payment was declined, Butt and his two accomplices rented a smaller van that they used to plow into crowds before they leapt from the vehicle and went on a stabbing rampage in an attack that left eight people dead and nearly 50 people injured. It was the third such deadly attack in Britain in three months.

After leaving the small white van, the men used 12-inch knives with bright pink blades, according to Dean Haydon, head of the Metropolitan Police's Counter-Terrorism Command.
Police also disclosed that multiple petrol bombs were discovered in the van, and a copy of the Quran opened at a page ""describing martyrdom"" was found at one of the attackers' houses.
Investigators believe three victims were killed on the bridge, including one man who was thrown into the Thames River, before the attackers left the vehicle and stabbed five people to death around London's busy Borough Market, Haydon said. Police believe Butt was driving the van.
""When I come back to Butt trying to get hold of a 7.5 ton lorry -- the effect could have been even worse,"" he said.
More than a dozen wine bottles filled with flammable liquid and rags wrapped around them in the shape of Molotov cocktails were found in the van. Two blow torches were also found.
Haydon said the men may have been planning even more bloodshed if they had survived their stabbing spree and made it back to the van.
Police also found a number of office chairs, gravel and a suitcase in the van.
Detectives believe the gravel may have been placed in the vehicle to make it heavier, or as part of a cover to justify hiring it, while the chairs may have been used to convince family and friends they were moving furniture.
Butt, a 27-year-old Pakistan-born British citizen, and his two accomplices, Rachid Redouane, 30, who claimed to be Moroccan-Libyan, and Youssef Zaghba, a 22-year-old Italian national of Moroccan descent, were shot dead by armed police eight minutes after the first emergency call.
The three attackers were wearing fake suicide belts consisting of plastic water bottles wrapped in grey duct tape.
Haydon described the pink knives as ""pretty unusual"" and appealed for anyone with information about where they came from to contact police.

Police raided Redouane's small residence on Tuesday and said he had been renting it since April. This was the safe house where the attack was planned, police said. In the residence, police found an English language copy of the Quran opened at a page describing martyrdom, pieces of cloth which appeared to match material wrapped around the petrol bombs and water bottles similar to those used in the fake suicide vests, police said. Luggage straps, plastic retractable craft knives and rolls of duct tape were also found.
Eighteen people have been arrested in connection with last week's attack. All but five have been released. Searches are continuing.
The question remains how the men met and knew one another but police said Saturday they did not suspect a wider plot.
""It looks as if it is pretty much a contained plot involving the three of them, which is supported by the forensic evidence we've got back so far,"" Haydon said.
Butt, who police consider the attack ringleader, had been on bail after being arrested for fraud in a case in October of last year, police said. He had also been repeatedly reported to police for violent behavior and trying to recruit young children to Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) as well as featuring in the documentary, ""The Jihadis Next Door,"" where he was seen next to a group of men unfurling a black-and-white flag scrawled with Arabic script and associated with ISIS.
""There was no evidence uncovered of any attack-planning in relation to him,"" Haydon said.
ISIS issued a claim of responsibility for the deadly attack in Central London in a statement more than 24 hours after the attack. The group's Aamaq news agency Quote: d a ""security source,"" saying, ""A Unit of Islamic State Fighters carried out London attacks yesterday.""
Butt had been warned by police on two occasions -- once for fraud in 2008 and once in 2010 for assault. Still, he did not have any criminal convictions.
Zaghba and Redouane lacked any criminal convictions or such warnings in Britain.
""From what I'm seeing, there is nothing that suggests at the moment that we got that wrong,"" Haydon said, referring to Butt.",London Bridge attacker tried to rent larger truck for deadly spree - CBS News,normal,b321de3af390977de7999d2701db0aa7b7b06dcc

As part of their broader effort to discredit Comey, Trump and his defenders have seized on his revelation that the former FBI director allowed a friend to share a memo detailing his conversation with the president to the press.
Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee Thursday that he leaked the document in the hope it would trigger the appointment of a special prosecutor.
A source close to Trump’s outside legal team said the president's personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz, will file a complaint regarding Comey’s leaked memo with the Department of Justice's Inspector General and the Senate Judiciary Committee.
 But legal experts say it's impossible to find any obvious violation in Comey's behavior, arguing instead that Kasowitz's threat is more likely a meritless attempt to bully Comey — which could have unintended ramifications for Trump.
""While Comey was criticized for his public comments during the campaign, none of them, nor the leaked memo, violates DOJ's rule prohibiting disclosure of information to the media,” said Stephen Gillers, an ethics expert at the New York University Law School.
Meanwhile, Gillers added, ""in no circumstance would the Judiciary Committee have jurisdiction to impose a penalty.""
It's unclear what rules exactly the complaint would accuse Comey of violating, since no known complaint was filed before the weekend.
“ They&apos;re going to compound the problem.” Comey recorded details of his meetings with Trump in personal, unclassified memos, and he said he asked a friend to provide the contents to an unnamed reporter. Leaks generally involve classified information, which are protected by law.
Kathleen Clark, an expert in government ethics at the University of Washington Law School, said there are a number of rules that protect the president's conversations with aides, but that none of them apply here.
""We do have law that applies here and it's called the First Amendment. And unless there's any other law that prevents that speech, it's protected by the First Amendment,” Clark said. ""I'm searching for any possible reasons it could be a problem and can’t find one."" The First Amendment protects freedom of speech and the press.
If the White House believed there were any rules prohibiting Comey from sharing his conversations with the president, they should have asserted that before his testimony, she said. Instead, they publicly waived executive privilege and let Comey’s testimony proceed.
And it seems unlikely that Comey, who led the FBI as it pursued investigations into government leaks, and thus presumably knows the law here well, would incriminate himself on live TV while testifying before the U.S. Senate, Clark added.
Kasowitz’s threat is ""bluster,"" Clark said.
 Richard Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration and a frequent Trump critic, said Comey could be considered a witness in the ongoing investigation being led by special counsel Robert Mueller into alleged Russian meddling in last year's elections and related matters.
""The Department of Justice reports to the President of the United States. And the President of the United States is saying, 'you're going to be a witness against me? I'm going to open an investigation against you' — that's clearly witness intimidation, and that itself is obstruction of justice,"" Painter said.
""So they're going to compound the problem,"" he said.
Painter said he's never heard of a former government employee being investigated for sharing unclassified information, noting entire shelves could be filled with books written by former officials revealing the inner workings of the White House.
""It's the worst idea in the world,"" Painter said.",Why Donald Trump's Attempt to Go After James Comey Could Backfire - NBC News,normal,99b72ac3b243a215d1a7d7c830d17ad772d0c9d3

""Those claims falter on threshold grounds: no Plaintiff has alleged an injury"" that meets the standing requirement, the DOJ says in a document submitted in federal court.
The administration's argument is a response to the lawsuit filed in January in the Southern District of New York by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The suit claims Trump is violating the Emoluments Clause whenever foreign entities book rooms at the Trump D.C. hotel or lease Trump office space.
The Emoluments Clause bars presidents from taking money from foreign governments.
CREW is asking the court ""to stop Trump from violating the Constitution by illegally receiving payments from foreign governments"" with ties to Trump business interests. The lawsuit states:
""These violations of the Foreign Emoluments Clause pose a grave threat to the United States and its citizens. As the Framers were aware, private financial interests can subtly sway even the most virtuous leaders, and entanglements between American officials and foreign powers could pose a creeping, insidious threat to the Republic.""
The suit cites numerous examples of how Trump personally stands to profit from doing business with companies linked to foreign governments. For example, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which is owned by the Chinese government, is a tenant at Trump Tower in New York, and its lease is due to expire during Trump's term, the suit says.
That means the Chinese government would be in negotiations with the Trump Organization to renew the lease — and it might agree to extremely favorable terms that, in effect, would be a financial gift to the president.
""CREW, which avers that the President's conduct is in conflict with its mission of preventing official corruption, has proffered only an abstract injury of the sort long held insufficient to confer standing,"" the administration's filing says.
""It's clear from the government's response that they don't believe anyone can go to court to stop the president from systematically violating the constitution. We heartily disagree and look forward to our day in court,"" CREW's Communications Director Jordan Libowitz says in a statement about the administration's motion.
Friday's White House response is just one of many legal steps that would have to be taken before a court could decide the case. The next step will involve CREW responding to the administration's filing, and on it will go as it makes it way through the court.
The CREW suit was filed by legal scholars and former White House ethics officials, including Richard Painter, ethics adviser to President George W. Bush; Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe; Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at the University of California, Irvine; and Supreme Court litigator Deepak Gupta.",Trump Administration Calls For Lawsuit About His Businesses To Be Dismissed : The Two-Way : NPR,normal,3d0a6eea483ba322a73e23693cd9aabaf5cb0a1c

We do teach people that rape and assault is wrong, yet some people still do it. We also teach that murder is wrong. Some people still murder, yet nobody is saying ""we need to teach people that murder is wrong"".
Everybody knows that rape and assault is illegal, and if we want to do better there is certainly room for improvement on the empathy side of teaching - i.e. WHY you shouldn't do them goes far beyond ""because they are illegal"".
At the same time though, there will always be a portion of the population who doesn't care about right and wrong. Be it the person who rapes because they think the world owes them or the person who murders because the voices told them to. Those are the people who ""victims"" should be prepared for, because no amount of ""teaching"" is going to get rid of them. Let's reduce their numbers as best we can, but let's also acknowledge that we aren't eliminating them any time soon.
TLDR - Both sides of this debate would get a lot more done if they could be bothered to find out what they agree about before fighting about the rest.","Indiana lawmaker under fire for ""how not to be a victim” rape post",normal,4e31eb1d54ab2e36fa1c88eca672ef7beb32dd78

In this photo from a video provided by the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, Claudia Rueda, front, thanks supporters after her release from the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego Friday, June 9, 2017. A judge on Friday ordered the release of Rueda while the government seeks to deport her to Mexico, rejecting arguments that two arrests while demonstrating in support of people in the United States illegally justified requiring that she wear a monitoring device. National Day Laborer Organizing Network via AP Email 
SAN DIEGO -- A Mexican woman was released from custody Friday while the U.S. government seeks to deport her after a judge rejected arguments she should wear a monitoring device because she was arrested twice while demonstrating in support of people in the country illegally. 
Claudia Rueda, 22, plans to apply for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , a program started in 2012 under President Obama that shields immigrants who came to the U.S. as young children from being deported. Her case has drawn attention because she has no criminal record and is an immigration activist. 
The immigration judge, Annie S. Garcy, said holding Rueda without bond was ""unduly severe"" and allowed her to be released on her own recognizance. She noted Ruedas' academic and other achievements and was incredulous when a government attorney asked that Rueda be required to wear a monitoring device. 
""Wow, an ankle bracelet? Really?"" said Garcy, who is on temporary assignment from Newark, New Jersey, under an administration effort to give higher priority to cases along the U.S. border with Mexico. In February, federal immigration agents arrested more than 680 people believed to be in the country illegally. A statement by the Department of H... 
The government attorney, Matthew Hanson, responded that Rueda was arrested twice, once for trespassing and once for disorderly conduct. 
Her attorney, Monika Langarica, said those arrests occurred during peaceful demonstrations to support people in the country illegally. She was charged in only one case and it was dismissed. 
Rueda, a student at California State University, Los Angeles, was arrested on immigration charges May 18 outside a relative's Los Angeles home in connection with what the U.S. Border Patrol said was a drug smuggling investigation. 
Her mother, Teresa Vidal-Jaime, was arrested on immigration violations in April in connection with the same investigation and later released from custody. Neither Rueda nor her mother was arrested on drug charges. The Washington Post reports that the Trump administration is moving quickly to form a deportation force to fight illegal immigration. David Nakam... 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it would comply with the order to release Rueda and will consider any additional requests by her attorney. 
Langarica submitted legal arguments in support of Rueda that included letters from Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and U.S. Rep. Karen Bass, a Los Angeles Democrat. 
President Trump has upheld Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals while expanding the scope of immigrants subject to deportation beyond people with criminal convictions. 
During Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it arrested more than 41,000 people on immigration charges, an increase of nearly 40 percent from the same period a year earlier. Nearly 75 percent had criminal convictions. 
Rueda did not apply for the Obama-era program to shield young immigrants from deportation because she could not afford $465 application fee, Langarica said. A scholarship fund has since agreed to pay the fee, which is now $495. 
The hearing was held under tight security at a privately-run detention facility in San Diego, where Rueda has been held.

He should be back in Alabama chasing ambulances and hanging around the county courthouse complaining about the blacks and wishing he could get into the country club. Dumb luck and a vicious willingness to step on others to get ahead allowed him to rise to the Senate of the US. Then he hitched his wagon to Trump fairly early on when his racist instincts were stimulated by Trump's anti-Muslim tirades. Trump values those who joined him early and rewarded Sessions with the AG post. So now America has an incompetent racist boob heading the Dept. of Justice.

I don't see where it's any different than when Obama attempted to disrupt the democratic process recently in Israel. Everybody is doing it, in fact the US has pretty much turned it into an art form with all of the governments that we have been instrumental in overthrowing. I think the Dems just saw it as an opportunity to try to oust our newly elected president after their stinging defeat on that incredible evening in November 2016. Obama supposedly knew about it over a year before our election and chose to do nothing about it. I also think that the Hildebeaste knew about it when she tried to nail Trump down with her ""will you accept the results of the election"" question.

What. A. Day. I think we can now safely say that the only thing you can be certain about in politics is that you can never be certain of anything. And “uncertainty” isn’t a word anyone in the world of advertising wants to hear, as it usually means marketers are going to hold back on making big decisions and spending money.
“Lordy, I Hope There Are Tapes” Former FBI Director James Comey’s dramatic testimony Thursday was must-see TV: in the traditional sense, on internet livestreams and even in Russia , as the New York Post reports. Bars opened early and offices canceled their meetings as the U.S. stopped in its tracks to watch Mr. Comey accuse the Trump administration of lying and revealing he shared memos about his meetings with the president with a friend in order to leak the details to the press. TV ratings were likely to rocket (we don’t have the data yet), but, bizarrely, TV media-owner stocks—including shares of Fox, Comcast and Sinclair Broadcasting— took a dive Thursday . Nevertheless, in 2017, political hearings like these are turning into mainstream TV events , and some marketers could start to consider them more like “tentpoles” in terms of their ad placements.
Is Snap Crackling? Analysts at Nomura Instinet have voiced concerns about Snap’s ability to attract new users, pointing to data from app research company SensorTower that shows downloads of the Snapchat app have dropped 22% in the past two months, Fortune reports. What’s all the more worrying about that figure is that downloads of its more-established competitor, Instagram, have grown year over year. Nomura has slapped a “reduce” rating on Snap’s stock and lowered its estimates for the company’s revenue and profit for 2017 and 2018. Snap’s marketing to date has been sparse and subtle. If you’re a Snapchat user, you’ll know what that little ghost in your TSA tray at the airport is all about, but everyone else is probably clueless. It’s time to drop the nonchalant act and switch to user-acquisition to explain why people should download Snapchat if they’ve already got Instagram on their phones
Chinese Takeout China’s three biggest internet giants—Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu—are competing on a new battleground: to be the leaders in lifestyle. As The Wall Street Journal reports, the rivals are making frenzied investments to back lifestyle apps that do everything from hailing rides to booking vacations. Here’s why: “The data those services yield gives the companies more power to target consumers with tailored advertising, helping them capture a larger slice of the online advertising pie.” With 731 million internet users in China, user growth is peaking on their existing services across search, video, gaming, shopping and social media, so the trio must tap new revenue streams. Marketers should keep an eye on what is happening in China because internet giants in the West are likely to follow the trend, too.
Facebreaks Facebook put out some stats detailing *shock* findings that people look at their phones during the commercial breaks on TV. In other news, I’m just compiling the final data point on my ad-break-to-toilet-visit ratio report. In all seriousness, this blog post is another attempt by Facebook to encourage marketers to shift their TV dollars to its platform. “Be careful of false equivalences,” the blog reads, which, funnily enough, is exactly what TV companies say when digital platforms try to play up the size of their audiences. Here’s something from the blog post everyone can agree on, though: “Measure results not seconds.” Quite right. As luck would have it, another report dropped earlier this month, from Neustar Media (backed by Horizon Media and Turner, a TV company, so make of that what you will) that found that over a seven-year period, TV dominated all other media when it comes to return on advertising investment .
Best of the rest Alexis Berger, the former senior vice president of sales at mobile ad tech company Kargo, has been awarded $40 million in a third-party arbitration. She claimed she was the victim of “gender discrimination, retaliation, equal-pay violation, violation of wage law and breach of contract.” Kargo disputes the allegations and plans to contest the decision.

Both outbursts drew widespread condemnation throughout the U.K. and beyond, and raised the question: Are U.S.-U.K. ties irreparably damaged?
Most analysts would say the relationship may be a bit bruised but intact.
""The core of the relationship between the U.S. and U.K. rests on its nuclear, intelligence and special forces cooperation — and is usually protected from the vagaries of politics,"" said Tim Oliver of LSE Ideas, the foreign policy think tank of the London School of Economics. ""The U.S. and U.K. trust each other in ways we don’t trust anyone else in the world.""
That said, the usually courteous diplomatic relationship between the two nations may be a bit frayed.
After the terror attack on London Bridge and Borough Market , in which at least eight people died and 50 were wounded, Trump took to Twitter to describe Khan as ""pathetic.""
The president appeared to misinterpret Khan's comments that Londoners had ""no reason to be alarmed"" by the visible increase in armed police officers in the capital. Trump seemed to mistake the mayor’s words as a sign that he was soft on terrorism.
Khan then called for Trump’s expected state visit to the U.K. in October to be cancelled.
""I don’t think we should roll out the red carpet to the president of the USA in the circumstances where his policies go against everything we stand for,” Khan told British broadcaster Channel 4.
The spat was the latest example of tension between the U.S. and U.K. since Trump took office. In March, British intelligence agency GCHQ issued an angry denial of ""ridiculous"" comments Trump made suggesting that they spied on him at the behest of President Barack Obama.
And last month, Manchester police briefly stopped sharing intelligence after a series of leaks from the U.S. during its investigation into the bombing of the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester .
Meanwhile, May expressed regret over Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, although she notably didn’t join European leaders’ joint statement in support of the agreement.
“ Trump’s vision is not resonating across Europe” Less than a week before the election, May’s delay in defending London’s mayor did little to help her campaign, experts say.
""It is possible and even likely that some voters turned away from Theresa May as a result of her hand-holding with Donald Trump in the final days of the campaign,"" said Brian Klaas, a fellow in Global and Comparative Politics at the London School of Economics. ""Trump's decision to attack London Mayor Sadiq Khan in the immediate aftermath of the London Bridge terror attack was seen, across party lines, as a disgraceful move.""
May flew to Washington, D.C., in February and was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after he was elected.
""Brits and Americans should value the special relationship — it is essential for strategic interests and shared values on both sides of the Atlantic,"" Klaas added. ""But that relationship is under even more strain as the next government will be so fragile that it cannot afford to take on political damage from Trump.""
May’s inability to secure a majority in the House of Commons for her Conservative Party was a shock to many in the U.K ., where her party held an approximate 20-point lead in the polls over the rival Labour Party when she called the election in April.
May's Conservatives retained the most seats — but she looked set to join forces with ultra-conservative lawmakers from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to form a minority government.
""I don’t think that the relationship between the U.S. and U.K. was the key driver of the election by any stretch, but it’s clear that it didn’t play to May’s advantage,"" said Leslie Vinjamuri, an associate fellow for the U.S. and Americas program at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.
""The contours of this election demonstrate that the youth care about globalization and liberalism, things that Trump has distanced himself from,"" Vinjamuri added. ""Trump’s vision is not resonating across Europe. It suggests that there is support in the U.K. for having close relationship with Europe and being international player, issues that are challenged in current era of American politics.""","Is U.S.-U.K. Relationship Still 'Special' After Trump Spats, Shock Vote - NBC News",normal,4a95bac40c4d3d459fb268e2dfcc8cbbc968498c

Hello, and welcome to another excitement-filled edition of our weekly news roundup! 
Questions about federal law and discrimination for DeVos 
On Tuesday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos appeared before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, and Democrats pounded her with questions about civil rights protections, particularly for LGBTQ students and those with disabilities. After facing similar questions in a House subcommittee appearance last month, DeVos this time took a new tack, repeating the same answer at least 14 times: 
""Schools that receive federal funds must follow federal law."" 
At one point, Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, demanded, ""But what does that mean?"" 
The question went unanswered, and it's an important one, especially if the Education Department is suggesting, as it seems to be, that federal laws would offer vulnerable students meaningful protections from discrimination if they attend private schools, which are mostly religious, using vouchers. 
Attempting to answer Reed's question, NPR Ed unpacked the relevant federal laws — Title IX, IDEA, ADA, etc. — and found an important trend: When it comes to regulating private schools, especially private religious schools, federal law provides relatively weak civil rights guardrails. 
More on that here. 
The hearing was also marked for its pushback on President Trump's proposed 13 percent cut to education, coming from both sides of the aisle. 
""It's likely that the kinds of cuts proposed in this budget will not occur,"" summed up Sen. Roy Blunt , a Missouri Republican and chair of the subcommittee. History suggests he may be right . 
New York City announces school integration goals 
The nation's largest public school system released a plan this week to increase integration by race, income and English language learner and disability status. But advocates called it less than ambitious, and it didn't use the word ""segregation."" 
Seventy percent of New York City school children are black and Latino. But more than two-thirds attend schools that don't look like the city, with African-Americans and Latinos clustered in some schools and whites and Asians overrepresented in others. The same clustering is seen with regards to income. 
The city plans, within five years, to increase by 50,000 the number of students attending schools that reflect the city's racial demographics and to decrease by 10 percent the number of schools that are concentrated in terms of both poverty and wealth. The city will also simplify the all-choice admissions processes for middle and high school in an attempt to make it easier for families with fewer resources to access better opportunities. 
WNYC interviewed Ritchie Torres, a city councilman from the Bronx, who called it ""an incremental approach"" but one that ""legitimizes diversity as a public policy objective."" 
Chicago is an example of a large urban school system with an ambitious integration plan, which we covered here . 
Harvard students' admission rescinded over obscene Facebook memes 
At least 10 would-be members of Harvard's Class of 2021 had their admissions offers rescinded after a group exchange of racist and sexually offensive Facebook messages, The Harvard Crimson student newspaper reported this week. 
The Crimson reported that within a group of about 100, the students exchanged images with captions that made light of pedophilia and the Holocaust and had other offensive themes. 
Nationally, 43 percent of young people report they have personally been called offensive names on the Internet, according to a study released earlier this year by the nonpartisan think tank Data & Society. 
Billionaires disrupt education 
The New York Times took a look this week at the attempts by tech titans to transform public schools with what one scholar called ""a monopolistic approach to education reform."" 
In a wave of philanthropy on a scale not seen since the Rockefeller and Carnegie era, leaders like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Reed Hastings of Netflix, and nonprofits like Code.org, have each invested tens of millions of dollars in technology and direct grants to schools. 
Some of these investments serve companies' direct business interests, such as preparing more students for computer science jobs or selling software and hardware to what is projected to soon be a $21 billion ed-tech market. In all cases, concluded The Times , there is little independent oversight of these efforts and little independent proof of benefits to learning.

There's fallout, still, from Bill Maher's Friday show, in which he talked with Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, and declared himself a ""house n ."" The comment came after Sasse invited him to see how beautiful his state was by coming out and working in the fields. 
Black Twitter — and lots of other people's — exploded. Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, canceled his next-day appearance . There were calls for Maher to be fired, and plenty of arguments around free speech and the responsible use of it. In the end Maher apologized, and the show went on.

Meanwhile, in the world of books ... 
The Washington Post this week wrote about the history of the Green Book (full title: The Negro Motorist Green Book ). The book was a guide through the segregated South that black travelers depended upon to steer them to restaurants, hotels, guesthouses and shops that were ""Negro-friendly."" 
The Green Book stopped publishing in the mid-'60s, after America was de jure desegregated. But given the current political climate, some have suggested it might be time to revisit that idea. 
Moving on to computer games ... 
The Oregon Trail is a game set in pioneer-era America, where players get to manifest their destiny by assuming the role of Western expansionists. Indian Country Today interviewed one of the game's original creators (it was created in 1971). Don Rawitsch says if he were to redesign the game today, it would be a Native American version. 
The game has been used in schools to educate students about the rigors of the pioneer experience. The versions for mobile devices are popular, which is worrisome to some critics; the one-sided scenarios have no context. ""Part of why the game is dangerous is because you can pretend you're learning history and teachers endorse it,"" one university professor told Indian Country Today .

Theresa May, the prime minister, had hoped to boost her majority and win a mandate for Brexit. Instead her party lost seats and failed to make inroads in Labour strongholds. As The Economist went to press, the Tories were on course to win the largest number of seats—but perhaps not enough for a majority. Under Jeremy Corbyn, Labour performed much better than expected but could struggle to form a coalition.
Eight people were killed in London when three Islamists drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and then went on a stabbing spree in the trendy Borough Market neighbourhood. Almost 50 people were injured. The three attackers were killed within eight minutes by armed police, who were praised for their swift response. But questions were asked about why the men had been free to operate, given that they were already known to the intelligence services.

Building a presence
In a new report, the Pentagon said that China was building fighter-sized hangars, fixed-weapons positions and other military infrastructure on three islands it has built in the South China Sea. It said that when complete, the facilities would enable China to base three regiments of fighters in the disputed Spratly Islands.

In India , raids by federal investigators on the offices of NDTV, an influential liberal television station, and on the homes of its founders were criticised by many in the press as an assault on free speech. The raids were carried out to gather evidence on an alleged outstanding bank loan, which NDTV said had been repaid years ago. It maintains that it is the victim of a political witch-hunt for its sceptical reporting about the government headed by the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.
At least 19 people were killed in Kabul and another 90 injured when the funeral of the son of a prominent Afghan senator was targeted by bombers.

Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt all severed diplomatic relations with Qatar , and cut land, air and sea links with the Gulf state. They accused it, without providing evidence, of supporting and promoting terrorism. Donald Trump tweeted his approval, perhaps forgetting that Qatar hosts a large American air base.

I was warned that any attempt to discuss the case with the prosecutor in any way would be grounds for an obstruction charge. I was not a lawyer..but I worked in Regulatory.
I spoke with my own attorney and he confirmed that yes..discussing a case I was not assigned to or making any suggestions or even offering theories could be construed as obstruction because I was trying to influence the case.
Trump was trying to influence the Flynn case. It clearly was obstruction. Every lawyer knows this..even those arguing against it being called obstruction.
The point is..the GOP would be committing political seppuku to try to go after Trump so they must pretend it is not what it is and hope they can sway public opinion.
If the public believes it was obstruction or later it turns out Trump colluded or committed treason..they are in big trouble.
That is long term. The fire to put out now..is that the President who clearly tried to obstruct must somehow be exonerated or excused... This is the best they can hope for until the Mueller investigation concludes*

A lot is still unknown.At that moment he might not have technically been under investigation; but the investigation was and is ongoing, and has taken many turns. At any time, the president could have, and still may, come under investigation.Ironically, his interference with the investigation, and the firing of Comey, to try to impede the investigation is what has LIKELY ALREADY bought him trouble
All of the events that led up to Comey's firing[ private dinner;private/unwitnessed, subtle, but pressuring Oval Office meetings w Comey; and trying to enlist others to pressure him, or hinder the investigation]demonstrate that Trump systematically tried to stop the investigation .His own words to Lester Holt and to the Russians in the Oval Office are the most condemning. According to the president himself,he fired Comey to[ try to ] make the Russia investigation go away.
The investigation will continue; but he has done more than enough to warrant removal from office. Asking the FBI Director [ esp. one who is investigating his campaign/administration] is an abuse of power; and firing him to try to stop the investigation , on its face, looks like obstruction.

U.S. special forces are providing support to the military battling to reclaim the southern city, which has been partly under Islamist militant control for roughly two and a half weeks. Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images 
The Philippine military suffered its worst day yet in its fight to reclaim Marawi from ISIS-linked militants, losing 13 marines during heavy door-to-door fighting on Friday. Yet the casualties — which bring the number of military deaths there to 58 — mark just a ""temporary setback,"" a Philippine military spokesman said. 
It ""has not diminished our resolve a bit,"" Col. Edgard Arevalo said, according to The Associated Press . ""It instead primed up our determination to continue our prudent advances to neutralize the enemy, save the innocent lives trapped in the fight, and set the conditions for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Marawi."" PHOTOS: In Marawi, A Siege Threatens To Grind Into Stalemate 
The news comes as the U.S. has joined the fight in Marawi, offering the Philippine military assistance ""pertaining to exercises, training, technical assistance,"" another Philippine military spokesman said earlier this week . Lt. Col. Jo-Ar Herrera added that the U.S. special forces there are not directly engaged in the fighting. 
The U.S. Embassy in the Philippines confirmed the move in a statement released to several media outlets. 
‪""At the request of the government of the Philippines, US special operations forces are assisting the (Armed Forces of the Philippines) with ongoing operations in Marawi,"" the embassy said, according to the Philippine news service Rappler . The U.S. will ""continue to work with the Philippines to address shared threats to the peace and security of our countries, including on counterterrorism issues."" 
The AP confirms seeing a U.S. Navy surveillance aircraft high in the skies above Marawi on Friday, noting it ""flew above rocket-firing Philippine helicopters that struck militant positions, causing plumes of smoke to billow skyward."" 
An airstrike rips through a suspected militant hideout in Marawi on Friday. The U.S. is now providing ""technical assistance"" in the fight to retake the city, according to a Philippine military spokesman.

The U.S. is now providing ""technical assistance"" in the fight to retake the city, according to a Philippine military spokesman. Noel Celis/AFP/Getty Images 
Reuters notes that at least 200 militants — led by the Maute and Abu Sayyaf groups, both of which have pledged allegiance to ISIS — remain holed up in the city with about 500 to 1,000 trapped civilians. The militants have been using some of these civilians as human shields, Herrera said. 
""The key component we saw in the firefight with the marines [on Friday] was how the terrorists are using mosques,"" he said, as Rappler reports . ""The enemies took defensive positions there. They also used civilians as human shield."" 
Militants have controlled significant chunks of the city since May 23, when a raid to capture Isnilon Hapilon, Abu Sayyaf's leader, devolved into protracted violence. The Two-Way has reported that an alliance of extremist groups have held out against the siege using supplies stored in civilian sites such as mosques and schools, as well as a network of underground tunnels. 
Yet the militants appear to have suffered a major setback recently themselves. 
Herrera says the Philippine military is ""still awaiting confirmation"" that the Maute brothers, two leaders of the militant occupation, were killed in the fighting this week — but, as Reuters reports, Hererra says ""there are strong indications"" they were.",U.S. Backs Bid To Reclaim Marawi As 13 Philippine Marines Killed In Fighting : The Two-Way : NPR,normal,0c826d994d825e049af27e0a595518ce220f1c6b

.
As it happened, Joyce was one of those peculiar people who nurture habits ""different"" from ""regular"" people's, particularly when they are engaged in the process of creation (I mean creation of art, literature and music - a different kind of ""baby"".)
.
According to folks who knew him (his editor, publisher, and close friends) he wrote lying on his stomach in bed, with a large blue pencil, clad in a white coat. He did write most of Finnegans Wake with crayon pieces on cardboard. Because he corrected his own manuscript so many times, his publisher kept sending him crayons and cardboards.
.
There was a practical reason for his writing in this manner. Joyce had very bad vision. he suffered from myopia whcih developed into severe eye problems by his twenties. To make matters worse, he had a bout with rheumatic fever when he was twenty-five, which resulted in a painful eye condition called iritis. By 1930, he had undergone over 20 eye surgeries, none of which improved his sight. The large crayons thus helped him see what he was writing, and the white coat helped reflect more light onto the page at night. Also, like many creative people, night time was when they are most wide awake with creative juices flowing.
.
Many writers eschew using the typewriter (or these days the word processor in computers) and prefer to handwrite everything on paper. Peter O'Toole did his 2-volume autobiography that way So did Alec Guinness (if I recall correctly). Reportedly Stephen King hand writes his horror stories. I think handwriting creative work taps into a very different mental process. Difficult to explain.

Another player's rugby-shoed foot landed squarely on his lower face. The landing crushed his jaw and cut his tongue in halves. It is one of the most remarkble sentence I have read anywhere in Enlgish literature; beats a heart-rending King Lear lament by Shakespeare (except O'Toole only wrote one sentence, not 37 plays and 154 sonnets).

KABUL, Afghanistan -- An Afghan official says that two U.S. soldiers have been killed after an Afghan army solider opened fire on them in eastern Afghanistan. 
Attahullah Khogyani, spokesman for the provincial governor in Nangarhar province, said Saturday that two other U.S. soldiers are wounded in the attack, which took place in the Achin district. He said the Afghan soldier was killed after the attack. 
A spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan tells CBS News they are ""aware of an incident"" involving U.S. troops in the eastern part of the country and will provide more information as it becomes available. 
Khogyani tells CBS News the Afghan soldier was a commando. 
In a statement, the Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, claiming the soldier was a Taliban infiltrator. 
Such insider attacks have happened before in Afghanistan. In March, another Afghan soldier was killed after he opened fire on foreign forces at a base in Helmand province, wounding three U.S. soldiers.

Researchers say the fossils are the earliest known remains of Homo sapiens. Image via Philipp Gunz, MPI EVA Leipzig
The year was 1961. A barite mining operation at the Jebel Irhoud massif in Morocco, some 100 kilometers west of Marrakech, turned up a fossil human skull. Subsequent excavation uncovered more bones from other individuals, along with animal remains and stone tools. Scientists’ best guess was that the remains were about 40,000 years old and represented African versions of Neandertals. In the decades that followed, researchers shifted their stance on the identity of the remains, coming to see them as members of our own species, Homo sapiens —and they redated the site to roughly 160,000 years ago. Still, the Jebel Irhoud fossils remained something of a mystery, because in some respects they looked more primitive than older H. sapiens fossils.
Now new evidence is rewriting the story of Jebel Irhoud once again. A team led by Jean-Jacques Hublin of Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany has recovered more human fossils and more stone tools, along with compelling evidence the site is double the age experts previously believed it to be. The researchers describe their findings in papers published this week in Nature.
If the fossils do in fact represent H. sapiens , as the team argues, the finds push back the origin of our species by more than 100,000 years and challenge leading ideas about where and how our lineage evolved. But other scientists disagree about what, exactly, the new findings mean. In a way, far from tidily solving the puzzle of our origins, the Jebel Irhoud discoveries add to mounting evidence that the dawning of our kind was a very complicated affair.

Experts have long recognized that H. sapiens got its start in Africa. Up to this point, the oldest commonly accepted traces of our species were in Ethiopia: 195,000-year-old remains from the site of Omo Kibish and 160,000-year-old fossils from Herto. Yet hints that our species might have deeper roots had come to light. For instance, a skull with some modern characteristics from Florisbad, South Africa, was dated to 259,000 years ago—but the skull was assigned to a more primitive species, Homo heidelbergensis , and the date was never widely accepted. Clues have also come from studies of DNA recovered from human fossils. In 2016 researchers led by Matthias Meyer, also at Max Planck, reported that they had recovered DNA from fossils at the Spanish site of Sima de los Huesos that indicated H. sapiens split from its closest evolutionary relatives, the Neandertals, more than 500,000 years ago, implying an older fossil record of H. sapiens remained to be discovered.
To that end, Hublin and his colleagues have unearthed fossils of several other individuals from a part of the Jebel Irhoud site that the miners had not disturbed in the 1960s. Their finds included skull and lower jawbones as well as stone tools and the remains of animals the humans hunted. Multiple dating techniques indicate the stratigraphic layer from which the fossils and artifacts were recovered dates to between 350,000 and 280,000 years ago.
Analyzing the sizes and shapes of the Jebel Irhoud bones, the researchers found that the form of the face, lower jaw and teeth was distinct from Neandertals and other archaic humans. In these features the Jebel Irhoud remains resembled H. sapiens . The braincase, however, lacks the round shape characteristic of modern humans and instead has the elongate shape seen in archaic humans. Such differences in braincase shape are associated with differences in brain organization. All things considered, the team concluded the Jebel Irhoud remains represent “the very root of our species, the oldest H. sapiens ever found in Africa or elsewhere,” Hublin said at a press teleconference. The remains reveal a group that did not have all of our hallmark traits yet but whose form could have gradually evolved directly into that seen in people today, he and his colleagues report in their paper describing the fossils.

The discovery “allowed us to envision a more complex picture for the emergence of our species, with different parts of the anatomy evolving at different rates,” Hublin said. Some parts, such as the face, attained their modern form early on; others, including the brain, took longer to reach the modern condition. He added that the findings do not imply Morocco was the cradle of modern humankind. Instead, taken together with other fossil discoveries including the Florisbad skull, they suggest the emergence of H. sapiens was a pan-African affair. Hublin said that by 300,000 years ago, early H. sapiens had dispersed across the continent. This dispersal was helped by the fact that Africa was quite different back then—the Sahara was green, not the forbidding desert barrier that it is today.
The Jebel Irhoud discovery coincides with findings from a separate study of ancient DNA made available this week on the bioRxiv preprint server ahead of peer review and publication. Carina Schlebusch and Mattias Jakobsson of Uppsala University in Sweden and their colleagues analyzed seven H. sapiens genomes from South Africa, from people who lived between 2,000 and 300 years ago. The researchers found that the groups to which these individuals belonged diverged more than 260,000 years ago, which would mean our species is at least that old. “The two new papers certainly complement each other,” observes evolutionary geneticist Alan Rogers of the University of Utah, who was not involved in either study. “The Jebel Irhoud paper tells us modern human morphology is older than we had thought. The Schlebusch et al paper says modern human populations have been separate for nearly this long.”
Not everyone is ready to accept the claim that the Jebel Irhoud fossils necessarily belong to H. sapiens , however. Paleoanthropologist John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin–Madison says their modern-looking traits might not actually reflect a connection to our species. He notes the analysis by Hublin and his colleagues did not compare the Jebel Irhoud remains with fossils from Spain dating to more than 800,000 years ago that belong to a species called H. antecessor . “There is an archaic human population with facial morphology that resembles modern humans in many ways, and it is a lot older than Jebel Irhoud,” he says of H. antecesso r. “Maybe Jebel Irhoud was evolving into modern humans, but another possibility is that it is retaining facial morphology from an H. antecessor –like population that may have been the last common ancestor of Neandertals and later African archaic humans.” 
Indeed the new fossils “raise major questions about what features define our species,” observes paleoanthropologist Marta Lahr of the University of Cambridge in England. “[Is] it the globular skull, with its implications on brain reorganization, that make a fossil Homo sapiens ? If so, the Irhoud population are our close cousins.” But if, on the other hand, a small face and the shape of the lower jaw are the key traits, then the Jebel Irhoud find could be one of our actual ancestors—and thus shift the focus of scientists who study modern human origins from sub-Saharan Africa to the Mediterranean—Lahr says.
Either way, the new discoveries seem poised to fan debate over who invented the artifacts of Africa’s Middle Stone Age (MSA) cultural period, which spanned the time between roughly 300,000 and 40,000 years ago. The archaeological record shows that during the MSA early humans across Africa and Eurasia moved away from making clunky handaxes to crafting more portable cutting tools using so-called Levallois methods for shaping stone. Researchers disagree about whether this new technology arose once and spread across the Old World as early humans dispersed or whether different populations invented the technology independently. And because the oldest MSA artifacts predated the oldest known H. sapiens fossils, experts had reason to believe that multiple species made MSA tools.

The new findings could change the equation, however. “I don’t believe the MSA is evolving independently all over the place, and the Irhoud date firmly places the earliest MSA within the sapiens lineage (or with sapiens itself depending on how the nomenclature issue settles), rather than before it,” Lahr says.
Other experts are cautious about linking the MSA to a particular species. “We have the potential for other lineages to still be on the landscape,” explains archaeologist Christian Tryon of Harvard University. “I’m hesitant to go straight from archaeology to species, particularly at 300,000 years ago, when [Homo] heidelbergensis and others may still have been running around.” Recently researchers dated fossils of Homo naledi , a small-brained human species whose remains have been found in South Africa, to between 335,000 and 236,000 years ago—meaning it was among the other humans on the scene during the MSA.
“The big story right now in human evolution is that Africa 250,000 years ago was not what we thought it was, and the formation of African modern human populations from that time period was a very complicated process,” Hawks says. “I think that people had this assumption that once you knew modern humans evolved in Africa, that solved everything. That assumption led to the notion that whatever African fossil record there was must be the ancestors of modern humans. It turns out that’s massively oversimplified. There are several different lineages of archaic humans, Homo naledi and others, that genetics is suggesting must have existed. And we don’t know how most of the fossils fit. That’s where Jebel Irhoud is—we now know its age, but we still don’t know how it fits in.”
The new finds “make the picture nicely complicated,” Tryon agrees. “I like a messy story and this contributes to it.” But it also means the scientists chasing the origins of our own species have their work cut out for them. Sometimes the most familiar things are also the most mysterious.

to create memoranda to file suggests that these are arguably government
documents. Comey admitted that he thought he raised the issue with his
staff and recognized that they might be needed by the Department or 
Congress. They read like a type of field 302 form, which are core 
investigatory documents.
The admission of leaking the memos is 
problematic given the overall controversy involving leakers undermining 
the Administration. Indeed, it creates a curious scene of a former 
director leaking material against the President after the President 
repeatedly asked him to crack down on leakers.
Besides being 
subject to Nondisclosure Agreements, Comey falls under federal laws 
governing the disclosure of classified and nonclassified information. 
Assuming that the memos were not classified (though it seems odd that it
would not be classified even on the confidential level), there is 18

Sunday's Tony Awards is Broadway's biggest night, and while musicals usually get most of the attention, the play ""Sweat"" is up for three awards and has already won the Pulitzer Prize for drama. 
The play captures, and some say predicted, a number of the most important and divisive issues of our time, such as race, class and immigration, reports CBS News' Jamie Wax. Tony Awards 2017: How to watch 
Research, humanity and tremendous talent combine on stage in a powerful take on the plight of the American working class. 
""Sweat"" takes place almost exclusively inside a bar. It's the happy hour hangout of union workers in a Reading, Pennsylvania steel factory. 
""I think for me the bar is a place where people unwind and people relax but I also think that liquor has this incredible power to get people to tell the truth,"" said Nottage, the playwright of ""Sweat,"" which is directed by Kate Whoriskey. ""Sweat"" 
""When I was writing the play, I really felt like I was holding a hammer in my hand. Just because I was so angry about the fact that there was this huge swath of America that was not being seen,"" Nottage said. 
""Sweat"" alternates between six years after the North American Free Trade Agreement became law and the 2008 aftermath of the world financial crisis. 
That was a time of bailouts for car companies and big banks. 
In 2011, the Occupy Wall Street movement drew thousands of angry Americans, including Nottage. 
""And I spent probably another week or two -- going to Occupy Wall Street, and eventually felt like it wasn't enough. I needed to understand what was happening in our country. Why was our American narrative shifting so quickly?"" Nottage said. ""Sweat"" 
An article in the New York Times led Nottage 150 miles away to Reading, Pennsylvania. 
""And it basically had said that Reading was the poorest city of its size,"" Nottage said of the article. 
""When I began interviewing people, we always asked the question, 'How would you describe your city?"" and people inevitably said, 'Reading was' -- that they always spoke of their town in past tense and that really sort of saddened and shocked me,"" Nottage said of what she discovered in Reading. 
""You have this generational tension in which you had one generation that was so aspirational and achieved for so long that suddenly finds they can't pass that same bounty to their children,"" Nottage explained. 
Whoriskey joined Nottage about a year later. Together they interviewed locals and visited places like Mike's Tavern. Eventually a narrative and characters began to emerge -- like Cynthia and Tracey. 
The two best friends on the factory floor are played by Tony nominees Michelle Wilson and Johanna Day.

KABUL, Afghanistan -- An Afghan official says that two U.S. soldiers have been killed after an Afghan army solider opened fire on them in eastern Afghanistan. 
Attahullah Khogyani, spokesman for the provincial governor in Nangarhar province, said Saturday that two other U.S. soldiers are wounded in the attack, which took place in the Achin district. He said the Afghan soldier was killed after the attack. 
A spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan tells CBS News they are ""aware of an incident"" involving U.S. troops in the eastern part of the country and will provide more information as it becomes available.
A White House spokesperson said President Trump is following the ""emerging situation in Afghanistan"" from his golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Khogyani tells CBS News the Afghan soldier was a commando.

Such insider attacks have happened before in Afghanistan. In March, another Afghan soldier was killed after he opened fire on foreign forces at a base in Helmand province, wounding three U.S. soldiers.

At one point Saturday, it looked as if Simona Halep was on her way to her first ever major victory. She’d won the first set of the French Open against her unseeded opponent, and despite fierce play from Jelena Ostapenko, few onlookers expected the unseeded Latvian to mount a comeback. 
So much for that. 
On the strength of an unrelentingly aggressive attack, hitting just about as many unforced errors as she did winners, Ostapenko ultimately wore down Halep, taking the second and third sets in thrilling fashion. Ostapenko, only a few days removed from her 20th birthday, upset Halep to take home her own first-ever major. 
She won the final, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3. 
“I cannot believe I am champion at 20 years old. I love you guys. It’s so amazing to be here,” she said after the match. 
She added: “I knew Simona was a great player. But I tried to play aggressive and everything turned my way. I fought for every point. I’m glad it finished my way.” 
As The New York Times reports , Saturday’s win makes Ostapenko the first unseeded woman to win the French Open since 1933. The paper notes she is also the first Latvian ever to win a singles Grand Slam.",Jelena Ostapenko Pulls A Thrilling Upset To Win The French Open : The Two-Way : NPR,normal,af3c96c921e5ece1437f5c283c30b41442477b4f

Another player's rugby-shoed foot landed squarely on his lower face. The landing crushed his jaw and cut his tongue in halves. It is one of the most remarkble sentence I have read anywhere in Enlgish literature; beats a heart-rending King Lear lament by Shakespeare (except O'Toole only wrote one sentence, not 37 plays and 154 sonnets). Now please ask me how the tongue, severed into two pieces was put back together. Ans: turned out you don't sew a tongue together 'cause the tongue tissues don't work that way; you have to glue it together. So poor Peter O'Toole had his jaw and mouth sewn shut with glue between the severed tongue for something like 10 days (or maybe 8, it's been a long time I read his auto bio).

.
As it happened, Joyce was one of those peculiar people who nurture habits ""different"" from ""regular"" people's, particularly when they are engaged in the process of creation (I mean creation of art, literature and music - a different kind of ""baby"".)
.
According to folks who knew him (his editor, publisher, and close friends) he wrote lying on his stomach in bed, with a large blue pencil, clad in a white coat. He did write most of Finnegans Wake with crayon pieces on cardboard. Because he corrected his own manuscript so many times, his publisher kept sending him crayons and cardboards.
.
There was a practical reason for his writing in this manner. Joyce had very bad vision. he suffered from myopia whcih developed into severe eye problems by his twenties. To make matters worse, he had a bout with rheumatic fever when he was twenty-five, which resulted in a painful eye condition called iritis. By 1930, he had undergone over 20 eye surgeries, none of which improved his sight. The large crayons thus helped him see what he was writing, and the white coat helped reflect more light onto the page at night. Also, like many creative people, night time was when they are most wide awake with creative juices flowing.
.
Many writers eschew using the typewriter (or these days the word processor in computers) and prefer to handwrite everything on paper. Peter O'Toole did his 2-volume autobiography that way So did Alec Guinness (if I recall correctly). Reportedly Stephen King hand writes his horror stories. I think handwriting creative work taps into a very different mental process. Difficult to explain. I personally feel the same way about writing.",Hysteria over hyphens,normal,0b7336d37f87d66d2fc3f02dae9f3322f55f1030

Photo by Jonathan Ernst/Reuters
WASHINGTON — The FBI chief he fired called the president a liar, but the response from many Republicans was a collective shrug. The GOP still needs Donald Trump if it has any hope of accomplishing its legislative agenda and winning elections, and it’s going to take more than James Comey’s testimony to shake them.
RELATED LINKS Read James Comey’s prepared statement before Thursday’s Senate hearing Important takeaways from Comey’s Senate hearing Trump accuses Comey of lying to Congress Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Friday boasted of the GOP’s accomplishments under Trump thus far, and promised more to come, making no mention of Comey in a speech. A group of House conservatives discussed taxes and the budget, with no reference to Comey or the federal investigations into Russia’s election meddling and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.
Elsewhere, there were few outward signs of concern from the top Republican officials, donors and business leaders who gathered largely behind closed doors in Park City, Utah, for a conference hosted by former presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
“The people in this room, who give money to the Republican Party and who are focused on helping get Republicans elected, they do it because they believe in an agenda,” Spencer Zwick, House Speaker Paul Ryan’s fundraising chief, said in an interview. As for the Comey testimony, “there’s nothing we can do about it,” Zwick said.
It all underscored what’s become a hardening dynamic of the Trump presidency: Republicans on Capitol Hill and off are mostly sticking with the president despite the mounting scandals and seemingly endless crises that surround him.
Though some are privately concerned, and frustration is regularly voiced about the president’s undisciplined administration and the distractions he creates, Republicans have scant incentive to abandon him now. Trump’s signature remains key to the still-nascent GOP agenda, and he has the ability to appoint judges to lifetime appointments, a thrilling prospect for conservatives.
And, despite Trump’s low approval ratings nationally, his core base of supporters remains firmly behind him. Those voters will be key to the GOP’s success in next year’s midterms when Republicans will be defending a fragile majority in the House and looking to pick up seats in the Senate, thanks to a favorable map that has a large group of Democratic incumbents up for re-election in states that voted for Trump.
“I think the last 24, 48 hours were all good for the president, confirmed he was telling the truth all along, that he wasn’t under investigation,” GOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said Friday, referring to Comey’s confirmation that he had informed Trump that the president wasn’t being personally investigated.
218432 218423 218423 What does Comey’s testimony mean for the Russia probe? While the nation watched, former FBI Director James Comey offered a raft of revelations about his interactions with President Trump in a hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, his first public appearance since being fired. Lisa Desjardins, John Yang and Matt Apuzzo of The New York Times join Judy Woodruff to discuss the major headlines that emerged from his testimony. 2017-06-08 06:00 pm disabled 3001664418 xU74HtRPlXc Comey also bluntly accused the Trump White House of lying, asserted that Trump asked him to back off an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and contended that Trump fired him in an effort to change the course of the Russia investigation. But Republicans chose to ignore those things and focus on the aspects of Comey’s testimony on Thursday that were favorable to Trump. Trump himself, appearing alongside the president of Romania on Friday, attacked Comey and said some of his testimony wasn’t true.
“I think he was exonerated,” GOP Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Friday of Trump. “He said that he wasn’t under investigation and indeed that was verified.”
Ryan and other Republicans explained away Trump’s interactions with Comey as the understandable blunders of a Washington neophyte.
“It’s no secret to anybody that this president is not experienced in the ways of Washington, of how these investigations work,” said GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who sits on the intelligence committee. “When you have the FBI director telling you three times you’re not the subject of an investigation and you ask him, ‘would you please announce that publicly’ and he refuses, I can understand why the president would be frustrated by that.”
Outraged Democrats argued that Comey had laid out all the elements of an obstruction of justice case, even as Democratic leaders tried to tamp down calls for impeachment coming from some liberals, including some members of Congress. Chances that Republicans themselves would initiate or even consider impeachment proceedings were zero, and that will change only if the Justice Department special counsel on the case, Robert Mueller, delivers a verdict they cannot ignore whenever his investigation concludes.
To be sure, not all Republicans were so quick to dismiss Comey’s testimony and the Russia investigation.
The Tucson Weekly published quotes from what it said was a private talk by GOP Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona to the Arizona Bankers Association last week. McSally, who represents a closely divided district targeted by Democrats, expressed concerns that the House majority could be at risk partly because of “distractions” from Trump and his tweets.
“Any Republican member of Congress, you are going down with the ship. And we’re going to hand the gavel to Pelosi in 2018,” McSally said, referring to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California. “The path to that gavel being handed over is through my seat. And right now, it doesn’t matter that it’s me, it doesn’t matter what I’ve done. I have an ‘R’ next to my name and right now, this environment would have me not prevail.”
A litmus test comes in two weeks when voters choose a new House member in a competitive Georgia district, where a GOP loss would unnerve some two dozen incumbents like McSally.

Let's see if you can quickly identify the problem ... : After about seven months of reading the 'US FBI' 'apparently' 'seems' 'to feel' 'there may have been' and then citing the sources you're citing with 'anonymous sources tell' ...
"" it has even been posited by some fairly respectable sources (which are 
fully attributable)""
But we know the basic facts are this...
The Emir of Qatar, was quoted in a speech to a graduating military class of his, in May of 2017, where he spoke, several times, in glowing terms about the Muslim Brotherhood, Hezbollah, and Iran. It was carried on Al Jazeera, the Qatar owned and funded news broadcasting channel, throughout the Middle East.
Sensing the mistake, Al Jazeera quickly deleted the comments and blamed it on hackers. No matter. It triggered a diplomatic crisis with Saudi Arabia.
A Saudi Arabia, that by the scale and swiftness of the response, had obviously set it up in advance. Maybe this was the trigger they were waiting for. Maybe they even triggered it. And maybe if it wasn't this trigger, it would have been another.
Reaction by the other six GCC nations was immediate and swift. Embargo, and 10 demands by Saudi Arabia, to be accomplished within 24 hours.
The Emir of Qatar did make the speech. Al Jazeera, as always, carries his speech. Qatar has a small ruling council and they didn't think it through.
Geo-politically it doesn't make sense for interference by Russia, because the only security guarantor that can guarantee the security of Qatar is the United States. This just allows Saudi Arabia to make their ten demands, and stop Qatar from flirting with the Muslim Brotherhood, Hezbollah, and Iran.
And on top of that it makes the United States look good because it gets to look on benignly as the good cop, keeping an outraged Saudi Arabia at bay. While getting those ten demands it wants, which allign with Saudi Arabia interests, too. We might have even helped a little with this.

- not just the forced military take-over of Crimea, but lest we forget, the rigged elections prior to that, and the installation of a (there's no other way to describe it in Crimes) puppet President (please refer to Paul Manefort for further details).
- interference in the 2016 US Presidential elections (wherein any actual effect to the outcome is, as of yet, indeterminate)
- interference in the French elections (hacking the night before the weekend news blackout prior to the election itself)
- it has even been posited by some fairly respectable sources (which are fully attributable, and I've listed a few of them below) that Vladimir Putin interfered with the initial Brexit vote when Britain decided to leave the European Union.

http://www.vanityfair.com/n... 
https://www.bloomberg.com/p... 
- and this latest in which Vladimir Putin seems to've hacked Qatari media. Not personally, needless to say.
But if we see all of these events, taken together to make a not-particularly-subtle pattern (I mean, it's not very difficult to see, even just at a glance), and no matter what one's political, ideological, and/or religious affiliations happen to be, ...there is Vladimir Putin standing suavely at the end of each one of these pathways telling us convincingly (often lyrically) that we must be out of our minds. And somehow that's *not* a very well dressed, very well spoken version of Donald Trump telling us ""fake news"" regardless of the evidence of our own eyes right in front of us, ...every, ...single, ...time.
And these are adding up, yes?
The Emir of Qatar is very definitely *not* an un sophisticated man. And presumably, the other leaders in the region (as well, we are told, Mr. Tillerson, Gen. Mattis, et al) have known him for some time. Would he choose this moment to blunder on television or the internet, bluster about a contentious nation in the region, and then cry out ""fake news"", under the assumption that everyone in the world would take him for Donald Trump and happily go their merry way?
After all of the skilled and well intended attempts to restore peace in the region lately, look at our Fearless Leader's wise reply of this very evening? I would not allow that man to roam untethered in an establishment offering fine porcelain for sale.
And honestly, very sincerely, that is *not* how I see the leader of Qatar (regardless of whether everyone there agrees with everyone else or not).
The trouble is that, thanks to Mr. Trump, these days, any time anyone says ""fake news"" it *implies* that it must be *true* news (!?), yes? Just to show you how convoluted and backwards the world has become these days.
And at that juncture, I give you (drum roll please, ...and an appreciative *gasp* from the audience), ...Mr. President Vladimir Putin!
One and all, regardless of race, creed, color, religion, gender, sex, politics, or ideology, ...Mr. President Vladimir Putin has sought to entertain us all with sleights of hand, and prestidigitations to confuse and amaze. All over the world. On an equal opportunity basis. To friends and enemies alike. And thanks to his talent and skill, instead of according him the credit that he so richly deserves (vigorously, robustly), ...we have instead been back and forth battering each other like cavemen (and women, ...equals, as I mentioned).

That is a large audience for a daytime event, though it is short of the 30.6 million who tuned in to President Donald Trump's inauguration in January.
 Nielsen's estimates include people watching on 10 U.S. broadcast and cable television networks, but not those who streamed the congressional hearing on computers or mobile phones. Broadcasters interrupted regular programming to air nearly three hours of live coverage of Comey's remarks about his dealings with Trump before the president fired him in May.

The tally was impressive for an event that aired during the work day, when typically only events like state funerals and royal weddings draw mass viewing, said Jeffrey Jones, director of journalism's Peabody Awards and a professor at the University of Georgia. Jones was traveling and saw crowds gathered around TVs in Atlanta's airport to watch the hearing.
""Politics is quite often about theater and drama, and this was a classic showdown,"" he said. ""People wanted to see it for themselves.""
The television ratings do not include the many people who watched the highly anticipated hearing during at bars and restaurants or online through TV network apps or on social media sites.
Alphabet Inc's YouTube reported nearly 800,000 peak concurrent viewers across streams from 20 news outlets. Twitter Inc. said the average minute audience for its livestream of Bloomberg's coverage was 129,000 viewers.
The year's most-watched television event is football's Super Bowl, which attracted 111 million viewers in February. Game Three of basketball's NBA Finals pulled in about 20 million for its primetime broadcast on Wednesday.
 During his appearance, Comey told that he believed Trump dismissed him to try to undermine a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into possible collusion between Trump's 2016 presidential campaign team and Russia.
Trump on Friday said Comey's testimony showed ""no obstruction.""",Comey Hearing's TV Ratings Were Big — but Did It Beat the Super Bowl? - NBC News,normal,d4374f961078e630d32f2fed56538e1814e120e3

OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma Republicans like to boast that their state is the reddest of the red, with their party holding every statewide elected office and every one of the state’s seats in Congress.
Democrats hoping to chip away at the Republican stranglehold have pinned their hopes on Anna Langthorn, a 24-year-old woman who has logged more than five years in the political trenches.
While acknowledging her age may raise eyebrows, the newly elected chairwoman of the Oklahoma Democratic Party hopes it will also help her to fan a growing enthusiasm in the state, especially among other young people, to shake up Oklahoma’s political system.
“There are a lot, a lot of voters who just aren’t voting because they haven’t been engaged, and a lot of those are young people,” she said from her bustling new office in Oklahoma City. “If we can present them with a party organization that reflects their values but also has a face they can relate to, they’re more likely to be engaged.”
Oklahoma went hard for Republican Donald Trump in November, to no one’s surprise. But Langthorn said she’s seen a dramatic increase in the number of young people showing up to local and state Democratic Party organizational meetings since Trump took office.
“All of those were tripled in attendance across the state,” she said. “We’ve had counties in western Oklahoma, in rural Oklahoma, that have not been active in the last decade, in some cases 20 years, that for the first time this year had people showing up who wanted to participate.”
In a special election for an open House seat last month in rural central Oklahoma, the Democratic candidate lost by about 2 percentage points in the same district a Republican won in November by 33 points.
Langthorn is among a growing number of millennials who have been tapped to lead state parties in recent years, including 28-year-olds William McCurdy II in Nevada and Kylie Oversen in North Dakota.
While North Dakota Democrats suffered major losses in 2016, including Oversen’s own state House seat, a growing dissatisfaction with Trump and an enthusiasm among younger voters could shift things dramatically for Democrats in 2018, said Ken Martin, leader of the Democratic Party in Minnesota and the president of the Association of State Democratic Chairs.
“We have seen young people in the past serve in these positions, but what I am seeing right now is just a wholesale new energy throughout the country,” Martin said.
Less than 45 percent of U.S. voters ages 18 to 34 cast ballots in November’s election. That figure was even lower in Oklahoma, where less than one-third of registered voters in that age group voted, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Those are voters that Langthorn hopes to engage.
Langthorn has her work cut out for her, especially healing a rift that deepened during last year’s Democratic presidential primary election between supporters of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. While acknowledging the division, Langthorn said she believes she’s the right person to help bridge the two factions.
“My hope is that I can marry those two groups in who I am as a person, that I do have very progressive values and beliefs and want to move the party in that direction, but I also recognize that there are people who have given 30, 40 and even 50 years of their life to serving this party, and their contributions and wisdom are still valuable,” she said.

An Afghan soldier opened fire on his U.S. counterparts on Saturday, killing three Americans and wounding at least one other. A spokesman for the provincial governor of Nangarhar, in eastern Afghanistan, confirmed that the incident occurred during an operation in the district of Achin, on the Pakistan border.
Afghanistan Not A Random Attack: New Details Emerge From Investigation Of Slain NPR Journalists ""In (a) joint US-Afghan military operation ... American troops were killed when an Afghan member of army commando opened fire on them,"" Attaullah Khogyani told Al-Jazeera earlier in the day. ""The Afghan commando was also killed in counterattack.""
The Associated Press reports that the Taliban has claimed responsibility for the shooting, noting that the militant group released a statement saying one of its loyalists had joined the Afghan military ""just to attack foreign forces.""
According to the wire service, the Pentagon says the U.S. military is ""aware of an incident in eastern Afghanistan.""
The Pentagon confirmed the number of deaths in a statement Saturday evening:
""Three U.S. soldiers were killed in eastern Afghanistan today. One U.S. soldier was wounded and has been evacuated for medical treatment. Next of kin notification is underway.
""This incident is under investigation. Additional information will be released as appropriate.""
Vice President Pence addressed the incident during an appearance Saturday.
""On my way here, I was informed that U.S. service members were killed and wounded at an attack in Afghanistan,"" Pence said Saturday at a speech in Milwaukee. ""The president and I have been briefed. The details of this attack will be forthcoming. But suffice it to say, when heroes fall, Americans grieve. And our thoughts and prayers are with the families of these American heroes.""
As Jennifer Glasse reports for NPR's Newscast unit, Achin has been a major base for Islamic State militants.
""U.S. special forces have been working on the ground there with Afghan forces,"" Jennifer notes, ""and in April, the United States dropped its [most powerful] non-nuclear bomb in the area to destroy tunnels being used by ISIS fighters — and killed dozens of them, according to locals in the area.""
She adds that shootings like the one that occurred Saturday ""are called insider attacks — or green on blue — with Afghans wearing green shooting Americans and NATO soldiers.""
And it's not the first time this year that one has occurred, as NBC News explains : ""The attack follows one in March in which three American soldiers were shot and wounded by an Afghan soldier on a base in Helmand province, officials said. That Afghan soldier was also killed following the incident.""
Reuters reports that shortly before Saturday's attack, at least three members of the Afghan security forces were killed by U.S. aircraft during an overnight raid in Helmand.
""We would like to express our deepest condolences to the families of the [Afghan Border Police] members affected by this unfortunate incident,"" a U.S. military spokesman said in a statement, according to the news service .

She thought she was being pulled over, but it turned out she was leading a funeral procession for University of Alabama coach Bear Bryant.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST: 
Bear Bryant. I knew that would make you silent. Bear Bryant - just invoking his name. Still a legend in Alabama - he coached the University of Alabama Crimson Tide for 25 years - six national championships - and became the flinty face of Alabama football. Paul Bryant - his parents didn't name him Bear - died in 1983 just a month after he coached his last game.
Marjorie Boykin, who was a student at the University of Alabama, Birmingham then, says that she ran home between classes to get a book one day when she noticed a motorcycle police behind her and people lining the freeway. They were holding signs and waving red-and-white pompoms, she told us. The signs said, we love you, Bear. That's when I realized I was leaving Bear Bryant's funeral procession.
(LAUGHTER)
SIMON: The hearse was right behind me. There were cars on either side, and I couldn't get into another lane. I just went with it and waved at folks until later, when the procession took an exit to the Elmwood Cemetery. Well, Coach Bryant always admired a player who could run their route.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST: 
I wait all week to say time for sports.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SIMON: Record-setting night for the Cleveland Cavaliers. They hit 24 3-pointers - 86 points in just the first half - to defeat the Golden State Warriors 137-116. Cleveland is now in the strategic position. All they have to do is win three more games - straight games - to submit their second NBA Championship. Of course, the Warriors have to win just one.
Jeh Jeh Pruitt of WBRC FOX6 here in Birmingham joins us onstage Thanks so much for being with us, Jeh Jeh.
JEH JEH PRUITT: Thank you for having me.
SIMON: Cavs were on fire last night, weren't they?
PRUITT: It was probably the single most impressive playoff game in the history of basketball, an unbelievable game.
SIMON: I knew I would love you. But go ahead, yes.
(LAUGHTER)
PRUITT: No. I mean, you talked about record-setting night - you know, 24 3-pointers, as you said. The Cavaliers scored 49 points in the first period.
SIMON: Yeah.
PRUITT: First period - 86 points at halftime. Who does that? I mean, who does that?
SIMON: Yeah - LeBron James team...
PRUITT: (Laughter).
SIMON: ...With Kyrie Irving. Obviously, they have to win three more.
PRUITT: Yes.
SIMON: That's going to be more difficult, right?
PRUITT: It is going to be very difficult for the Cavs to hit 24 3-pointers when they go back to Oakland. It is going to be difficult because the Warriors team is better than they were last year.
SIMON: Yeah, if you can imagine - because they added Kevin Durant. What sort of adjustments do you think the Warriors make looking forward to the next game?
PRUITT: Well they've got to get Stephen Curry back in the game a little bit. Stephen...
SIMON: He had just - was it 9 points last night?
PRUITT: Yes. He didn't score a single point in the first half, other than two free throws. So that's - you know, the Warriors are not going to win if Stephen Curry doesn't score any points in the first half.
SIMON: Tempers seemed short last night, which puzzled me. These are the two premier franchises in the NBA. Steph Curry even seemed a little upset, and he's, like, the nicest guy in the world.
PRUITT: Well, I'm not going to - I'm not on the NBA, so I won't get fined for talking about the referees.
SIMON: Oh, yes. Yes.
PRUITT: But that, to me, was one of the single most horrific refereed games last night. I'm not saying that because I'm a Warriors fan or anything. But, you know, it was too one-sided for me. I think that the Cavs - they...
SIMON: Having been surrounded by 20,000 screaming Clevelanders...
PRUITT: Right (laughter).
SIMON: ...You think the referees - yeah.
PRUITT: Now, I'm not taking anything away from the Cavs because the Cavs...
SIMON: Yeah.
PRUITT: ...Did their job. But, you know, the Cavs - they had to win. They were going to do everything they could to win, and they did. You know, so I don't want to take any credit away from the Cavs. They did what they were supposed to do. But it was pretty interesting to watch the refs do - I mean, you had seven players with technical fouls. You know, Draymond Green supposedly was supposed to be...
SIMON: Yeah.
PRUITT: ...Out of Game 5 and got in the game. But they actually called one of the technicals on Steve Kerr. So, as you mentioned, you know, the referees - they weren't playing last night.
SIMON: Yeah. I understand they play football here in Alabama.
PRUITT: Oh, yeah.
(LAUGHTER)
PRUITT: A little bit.
SIMON: Tell me a little bit how things look for the Crimson Tide. We're in the middle of offseason.
PRUITT: Well, you know, for all of you Alabama fans, they are preseason No. 1 again. They are looking pretty good. Nick Saban, you know...
(LAUGHTER)
PRUITT: Yeah (laughter). Nick Saban doesn't - you know, he doesn't recruit. He just reloads.
(LAUGHTER)
PRUITT: You know, he is - he's got - his third-stringers can be starters for anybody else. That's his secret, and they're going to be looking pretty good this year.
SIMON: Yeah. There's another team that plays locally, too, isn't there?
PRUITT: Yeah, the Auburn Tigers (laughter).
(APPLAUSE)
SIMON: Yes, I know. All right. I was giving you a chance to say that, OK? Yes.
PRUITT: (Laughter).
SIMON: How do things look for Auburn?
PRUITT: Well, you know, things are looking good for Auburn. They are probably going to do better than they did last year. Auburn had a really good run last year until the very - until their quarterback got hurt. And, of course, they didn't - they couldn't adjust to it. They actually won, like, eight games in a row until the very last end.
And so Gus Malzahn has got to find a way to beat Alabama. But he's also got to find a way to kind of make sure that everything is going well for the Tigers. You know, the Tigers - they'll be good for a second. And then they'll lose a very important game. So they can't do that if they're going to compete with Alabama.
SIMON: I'm sorry to end on this time with a serious question. But the concern about concussion that's in professional football - enough concern about it in college?
PRUITT: Yes. Yes, because they're doing everything they can. In fact, Dr. James Andrews Larry Lemak, one of the top - I guess the two orthopedic surgeons here not only in Alabama but in the world. Those two guys - they've actually done a lot of things, you know, with starting - with talking about it.
They've actually talked to a lot of NFL and college players. I think there should be - and I think there is a lot of concussion - a lot of people who are actually trying to talk about concussions because, as you know, I played football in college.
SIMON: Yeah.
PRUITT: I had a few concussions. I was never treated for it. And that's probably the reason why I stumble my words sometimes - because (laughter)...
SIMON: No, no, no. No, you never do. Jeh Jeh Pruitt, thanks so much for being with us.
PRUITT: Thank you for having me.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST: 
Something we learned this week - Birmingham once had its own Batman. Willie Perry, who lived in South Titusville - I love to say that town - Titusville, near here and worked in the cast iron furniture business, heard about a woman being attacked after her car broke down. And he decided to devote his life to helping others.
In the early to mid-1980s, Willie Perry drove his souped-up 1971 Ford Thunderbird around Birmingham and offered roadside assistance to those who needed help to start their car, change a tire or had too much to drink. Birmingham honored its Batman with a Willie Perry Day. Michael Jackson arranged to meet him. But in 1985, Willie Perry was working on his Batmobile, somehow the garage door got stuck, and he was overcome by carbon monoxide.
His daughter, who sometimes joined him on the rides to help others, said, I thought people were laughing at us because of the car. But when I started riding and seeing the passion from people in the city, it really gave me a different look at what he was doing. He was our super hero.

It closed in 2011 after 72 years.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST: 
You can never tell what turns life takes. A Birmingham man named Pete Koutroulakis won $300 in 1939 playing pinochle at the Greek Club here and used his winnings to open up a hot dog, stand 7 feet long, 20 feet wide. It became successful. Pete took a four-month trip to visit his aging father in Greece in 1948, leaving his nephew Gus to run the family business while he was away. But Pete Koutroulakis had a heart attack on his trip. Nephew Gus took over Pete's Famous, as the red neon sign above called the stand, and worked there practically every day for the rest of his life until Gus Koutroulakis has died in 2005.
He once told the Southern Foodways Alliance, there's something about these hot dogs. I mean, you can take a hot dog and wrap it up and put it in a sack and go out there and eat it. It doesn't taste the same as it does when it's in here. The preacher said it's something in these walls that says it makes it taste like that. The red neon Pete's Famous sign is in a Birmingham museum. Gus's secret sauce survives only in memory.

NPR's Scott Simon talks with local chefs Frank Stitt and Clayton Sherrod about contemporary Southern cooking.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST: 
Food and politics in Alabama are both local pastimes that can run deep and make you reach for the Pepto-Bismo - in the nicest way. Talk to anybody in Birmingham for more than a minute, which isn't hard by the way, and they'll tell you about their favorite spots for barbecue and the white tablecloth place that they first took their mother-in-law. There is a whole revival of Southern food going on - say hallelujah somebody.
UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Hallelujah.
SIMON: And Birmingham is in the middle of it.
Hi, chef. I'm Scott Simon.
FRANK STITT: Hey. Frank Stitt.
SIMON: Nice to meet you.
We found chef Frank Stitt at his French bistro in the Five Points South neighborhood, where folks dawdled over a late lunch. It's called Chez Fonfon.
STITT: I used to kid about things that were very, very French. And I would say - oh, that's so fon, fon, fon...
SIMON: Hence the name.
STITT: ...And so hence the name.
SIMON: Frank trained in elite kitchens in France and Northern California, but he grew up in Cullman, Ala., and wanted to come back.
STITT: To my people, to my family - that's when it kind of hit me. Well, let's take this - you know, what we've learned from California, from France, from Europe - and bring it back to Alabama, to Birmingham, close to my home.
SIMON: He did come back in 1982 and started Highlands.
STITT: So this is the secret passage...
SIMON: Oh, all right.
STITT: ...Between Chez Fonfon and Highlands.
SIMON: We walk out through a shaded courtyard and into a small, steel kitchen where prep chefs chopped, minced and went through the several stages of making one of Frank's signature dishes, baked grits like you've never seen.
STITT: Cooking them, adding butter and parmesan and lots of eggs and then putting them in a souffle mold and baking them and then unmolding them and serving them with a variety of mushrooms and prosciutto, country ham, fresh thyme and a sherry butter sauce. And so...
SIMON: (Laughter).
STITT: ...That's (inaudible).
SIMON: So truly not your grandmother's grits.
STITT: Not your grandmother's grits.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Not at all.
SIMON: We tried them. No, we shoveled them in with trowels. These grits were fluffy, light and airy. I heard Hank Williams sing along with a chorus of angels. Frank Stitt is considered the chef who first put Birmingham on food maps by making downhome ingredients into haute cuisine.
STITT: The butter beans and the field peas, lady peas and - those humble - kind of poor food of the South. Once we've kind of realized that we can be proud of those things - that we can create something that is unique but has a lot of soul.
CLAYTON SHERROD: Thank God for Frank Stitt.
SIMON: That's chef Clayton Sherrod, another Birmingham celebrity chef. His background is different than Frank Stitt's, but they have the same feel for what works on a plate.
SHERROD: You take what's here that your mother taught you. And Frank's mother taught him how to cook. My mother taught me how to cook. Do those basics and expound on that, and that is one of the secrets to the food scene in Birmingham, the reason it just really started changing. But it wasn't a secret. It was something that was already here.
SIMON: Chef Sherrod was in the eighth grade when his father died. He left school to take a job as a caddie at the local segregated country club to help pay the bills. But Clayton Sherrod was ambitious and wanted to work in the kitchen.
Now, let me point out in 2017, you know, one of these things that, I guess, was taken for granted at the time. You could cook food for the white people who were members of the country club.
SHERROD: Yeah.
SIMON: But you couldn't have lunch with them.
SHERROD: Could not have if - I remember one time. We were doing this party for an insurance company. They had one black guy on there who was of - on a certain level, like a vice president or whatever. And quite naturally, so you know, we had to feed them dinner. And man, word spread across that darn country club, like (whispering) there's a black person in the dining room. Say what? What is he doing in there? What? No. He's going to have dinner. I said, no way.
So the manager, L.J. Griffiths (ph), he got involved. And he called everybody together, the dining room staff. And what he did was have my waiters to go and get some room dividers and put the black person over in the right-hand corner. I will never forget the area. It was like a six-top or something. They set him up over in that right-hand corner and then got about four room dividers and blocked that darn six-top off...
SIMON: My God.
SHERROD: ...So that the other members couldn't be walking down the hallway and see that person eating in the dining room.
SIMON: My God.
SHERROD: It was - I mean, we went through a hell of a lot.
SIMON: Working hard and quiet was something chef Sherrod learned from his father. He remembers a terrible day when his father was pulled over in his car near their house for no reason and threatened with violence. His mother talked the police out of whatever they were about to do. His father returned to their house with great dignity but said nothing.
SHERROD: That was a change in time of my life, when Daddy got out of the car and went into the bedroom there, the front bedroom. And I was wondering, like, what? Why Daddy go in there and close the door? You know, he usually going to go out in the yard and do something, sit on the front porch. So I went - I opened the door. Daddy was in there trying to get him another pair of pants. He had peed on himself.
SIMON: Jesus.
SHERROD: That's what changed me. He knew that if he had said something, we wouldn't have been able to eat for quite a while.
SIMON: Yeah.
SHERROD: He wouldn't have been able to work. So that taught me something right then. Now, you got to come up with a reason to keep working. Don't let people intimidate you. That's how I made it at that country club.
SIMON: Clayton Sherrod became the first black executive chef at that segregated country club, just six years after he started as a dishwasher. Now he's got a catering company, appears on TV as much as any cable news pundit and just started a culinary school at Lawson State Community College.
What's the key to understanding food here?
SHERROD: To me, the key to food, especially in - let me just say this part of the country...
SIMON: Yeah.
SHERROD: ...Is realizing and recognizing the basics. While I was at the country club, I always cooked French, Italian. My first restaurant I opened was a French restaurant. Cooking things that was from somewhere else made me realize - here in Birmingham, we were good with doing what was - you know, cooking what's already here, what's being grown right around the corner, extremely fresh...
SIMON: I got to tell you, chef.
SHERROD: Mm-hm?
SIMON: I haven't seen a salad here yet that doesn't have pork in it.
SHERROD: (Laughter) You are in the South, man.
SIMON: (Laughter).
(LAUGHTER)
SIMON: Chefs Clayton Sherrod and Frank Stitt, just two of the great chefs of Birmingham.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST: 
The Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors are battling for the NBA championship with players in their 20s and 30s, but the Twomey brothers are in their 80s. They've been playing basketball this week in the National Senior Games in Birmingham. Sherrel Wheeler Stewart of member station WBHM has their story.
SHERREL WHEELER STEWART, BYLINE: Forget about the white hair, the Twomey brothers are basketballers. Their team, Pass It To Me, is one of six teams in the 80-and-over bracket in the Senior Games. At this game against the Pitbulls, John Twomey dribbles toward the basket, spots his brother Dan near the three-point range and dishes off for a quick assist.
(APPLAUSE)
STEWART: They defeated the Pitbulls 38-19 in the first game on Wednesday. Despite that win, they knew they needed to improve.
JOHN TWOMEY: I missed a lot of easy layups.
STEWART: That's John Twomey. At 83, he's the oldest brother and the unofficial team coach. He knows what's ahead. In the coming days, the number of games increases and so does the competition.
J. TWOMEY: We've got a team coming in here that's going to be playing in our age group with a guy that's 6'8"" and another guy that's 6'9"". We're going to beat them but it's going to be a chore.
STEWART: John is the tallest and he has a running hook shot to prove it. Eighty-year-old Tom is usually the best shooter. And his twin brother Dan is the speedster. That speed was on display in today's game. When Tom missed a layup, Dan hustled across the court, grabbed the rebound and laid it in.
TOM TWOMEY: Oh, man.
(APPLAUSE)
STEWART: The brothers began playing together as kids about 70 years ago. This is the second time all three have competed together in the Senior Games. It all gelled back on the farm in upstate New York. Back then, Dan says...
DAN TWOMEY: All we had was - at first was just a bushel basket nailed to the barn. And we would play there in the wintertime, as well as the summertime. It was wet or ice (laughter).
STEWART: The Twomey's parents were Irish immigrants who ran a dairy farm. The brothers and their sister Hannah were always busy with chores, but their parents encouraged active sports. The Twomeys say that focus on physical fitness sticks with them today. In Birmingham, the games last 30 minutes, and sometimes they play three games in a day. For Tom, that's not a problem.
T. TWOMEY: Like, I play four times a week for like an hour and a half, full-court, with younger people.
STEWART: And for John, who plays regularly, even after a triple bypass surgery last year, basketball is therapy.
J. TWOMEY: If I got a back ache in the morning, and I sit in the house and treat my back and all, I still got tomorrow. If I got a back ache today and I go out and play basketball, I don't have it tomorrow.
STEWART: The Twomey's team racked up five wins before getting eliminated Friday in their third game of the day. They're not taking home the gold, but they say they'll keep on playing. For NPR News, I'm Sherrel Wheeler Stewart in Birmingham.

There's a tiny island called Yap out in the Pacific Ocean. Economists love it because it helps answer this really basic question: What is money? 
There's no gold or silver on Yap. But hundreds of years ago, explorers from Yap found limestone deposits on an island hundreds of miles away. And they carved this limestone into huge stone discs, which they brought back across the sea on their small bamboo boats.It's unclear if these stones started as money. But at some point the people on Yap realized what most societies realize. They needed something that everyone agrees you can use to pay for stuff. 
And like many societies, the people of Yap took the thing they had that was pretty — their version of gold — and decided that was money. 
A piece of stone money was really valuable; you wouldn't use it for some everyday purchase. You'd use it for something big — a daughter's dowry, say. 
""If somebody was in real dire straits, and something happened to their crop of food or they were running low on provisions and they had some stone money, they might trade,"" says Scott Fitzpatrick , an anthropologist at North Carolina State University who is an expert on Yap. 
One key thing about this money: It was really heavy. A big piece could weigh more than a car. 
As a result, this very concrete form of money quickly made the jump to being something very abstract. 
""They often talk about the stones themselves not changing hands at all,"" Fitzpatrick says. ""In fact, most of the time they wouldn't."" 
So imagine there's this great big stone disc sitting in a village. One person gives it to another person. But the stone doesn't move. It's just that everybody in the village knows the stone now has a new owner. 
In fact, the stone doesn't even need to be on the island to count as money. 
One time, according to the island's oral tradition, a work crew was bringing was bringing a giant stone coin back to yap on a boat. And just before they got back to the island, they hit a big storm. The stone wound up on the bottom of the ocean. 
The crew made it back to the island and told everybody what happened. And everybody decided that the piece of stone money was still good — even though it was on the bottom of the ocean. 
""So somebody today owns this piece of stone money, even though nobody's seen it for over 100 years or more,"" Fitzgerald says. 
This system, in the end, feels really familiar. If you go online to pay your electric bill, what's really changing in the world? 
Some digits in your bank account get shifted around, along with some digits in the power company's bank account. 
In other words, that stone money on the bottom of the ocean that you used to own now belongs to the power company.

Our headline has been used before. It's the name both of a book about Yap , written a century ago, and a 1991 paper by the economist Milton Friedman, who compared Yap's monetary system to the gold standard.

French police and gendarmes stand at the scene of a shooting incident near the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France, June 6, 2017. Philippe Wojazer/Reuters Email 
PARIS -- The hammer-wielding man who attacked police officers patrolling in front of Notre Dame Cathedral appears to have radicalized himself through the internet and was unknown to French police and intelligence services, the chief prosecutor in Paris said Saturday. 
Francois Molins said the 40-year-old Algerian doctoral student is being charged with attempted murder in connection with a terrorist enterprise and crime of terrorist conspiracy. One police officer was slightly injured in Tuesday's attack. 
The assailant -- crying out ""This is for Syria!""-- was shot by police. He received hospital treatment for a shotgun injury to the torso. 
At least 600 people were blocked inside the iconic 12th century church while police secured the streets around it and combed the pews while visitors sat with their hands raised for the check. Others fled in panic from the sprawling esplanade outside the cathedral. CBS Radio News correspondent Elaine Cobbe joins CBSN from Paris with the latest details on an incident that happened near Notre Dame Cathedral, w... 
Molins told a news conference Saturday that the man had the ""profile of a neophyte"" that counterterrorism services fear as much as extremists who are trained to carry out attacks. 
""Today, the terrorist threat today is shape-shifting. And this time we have been confronted by an internal threat... individuals who want to carry out projects here when they have difficulties joining the war zones,"" Molins said. 
The assailant was identified as Farid Ikken this week by a nephew in Algeria, lawyer Sofiane Ikken, and a friend, Algerian journalist Kamal Ouhnia. 
Molins, who hasn't identified the suspect by his full name, confirmed that he was an ex-journalist born in Akbou, a town in northern Algeria, who was legally living in France as a student working on his doctoral thesis. Neal Sanche describes the incident outside Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, where a man was shot after allegedly attacking a police officer with a ... 
Investigators who searched a student residence where he lived in the Paris suburb of Cergy-Pontoise found a declaration of allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) he filmed on the morning of the attack. He presented himself as a ""soldier of the caliphate,"" prosecutors said. 
They have also found a laptop and four USB sticks that included Islamic extremist propaganda, photos and videos referring to attacks in London, Paris, Brussels and at a church in the French region of Normandy, and images of the war in Syria. 
The man described himself as a Sunni Muslim who started a ""quite radical"" religious observance about 10 months ago, Molins said. 
The suspect bought the hammer and two kitchen knives, which were found on him after the attack, in a supermarket on March 27. 
Molins said his family and friends didn't notice signs of radicalization. He described the man as socially and psychologically ""isolated."" 
Investigators haven't established the existence of any contact between the man and people living in Syria and Iraq. 
The youngest of a family of 12 children, the assailant moved to Sweden in 2001, where he studied journalism. He returned to Algeria in 2011, establishing an online newsletter and working as a journalist, before moving to France for doctoral studies in 2013, Molins said 
His brother and a cousin, both living in France, have described a ""solitary, serious, discreet"" man from a not very religious family. His thesis supervisor, who last saw him in June 2016, described him as a ""strong advocate of Western democracy,"" the prosecutor said. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

BRUSSELS -- A car struck pedestrians around Amsterdam's main train station on Saturday, injuring eight people. There was ""no indication whatsoever"" it was an extremist attack, police said. 
Six of the injured were hospitalized, with two of them in serious condition, police spokeswoman Marjolein Koek said. 
""There is no indication whatsoever that this is a terrorist attack,"" Koek added. 
Police said that the driver was parked in a place where he wasn't allowed to stop and drove off when approached by police and ran into a wall. Two of the injured were hospitalized and three others were treated at the scene. Veel politie, weinig informatie.

The incident received immediate widespread attention after several extremist attacks in Europe over the past year involving vehicles, including one in London last week . 
One witness, John Berg, shared his account of the accident on Twitter. ""Witnessed a car crash into a crowd by Amsterdam central station. Terrifying!"" he tweeted.

The afghan problem is not there because obama did not send in more army troops and spend more american money on keeping the war going. Afghanistan is like vietnam and is not winnable regardless of the amount of troops and money we spend. just like it was not winnable by the Soviets when they fought there for 12 years. And it was a war restarted by bush who did not win it after many many years of fighting during the bush presidency.
Besides, the american people elected obama to get us out of the wars in iraq and afghanistan. That was the will of the people. DId you forget what the will of the people was in 2008?
If you are simple minded, you just think that if a US president has the ""GuTS"" to send in troops and guns, that we would win.
But it is not that simple in 2 major ways:
1. We would not win there, we would fight there forever, and the minute we wanted to scale back, our enemies would come back across the mountain border from pakistan and be ready to fight us again.
2. IT is very very very expensive to fight wars with lots of troops and guns. We would need a big tax increase and that would still not pay for most of it. And the need for this year after year expense would never end.

“NewsHour Weekend” special correspondent Jeff Greenfield joins me from Santa Barbara, California, to discuss that. 
So, what did we miss? 
JEFF GREENFIELD, NEWSHOUR WEEKEND SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, the entire political universe was focused on the Comey testimony. 
Up on Capitol Hill in the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took the Republican repeal and replace Obamacare bill and put it on a so-called fast track. That means it can go right to the floor of the Senate with no committee meetings, no hearings, virtually no debate, and it would only take 50 votes to pass it. There were some concessions to moderates. It’s not clear that the most conservative senators will sign on, but it represents a significant step in that direction. 
On the other side of the Capitol, the House passed significant cutbacks of the Dodd-Frank bill. That’s legislation that puts significant caps on what big banks can do in the wake of the financial meltdown in 2008. That faces some tough sledding in the Senate, but what it indicates is that the Republican majorities in the House and Senate are determined to press ahead with the core Republican agenda on matters ranging from financial regulation to the role of health in the government and beyond. 
SREENIVASAN: Is there a pattern here on how they are going to pursue this agenda? 
GREENFIELD: Well, I think the pattern extends beyond Capitol Hill, and it indicates why some congressional Republicans who might have a lot of problems with Trump’s behavior are not going to be that willing to step away from him. 
The executive branch has done all kinds of regulatory changes. They’ve granted a lot of exceptions to the energy industry, to for-profit colleges. They’ve appointed into positions of government representatives from various interest groups and have given them exemptions from conflict of interest rules. They’ve clearly appointed some — or trying to appoint staunch conservatives to the federal bench. 
And that suggests that for congressional Republicans looking at Trump, there’s a thought that, well, he may have problems, but he seems to be pursuing what we conservatives have wanted the government to do for some time, which is why I think that they will be less inclined than otherwise to take sides against him in, say, a fight with the former director of the FBI. 
SREENIVASAN: So, where does this leave the president then? On Thursday, we heard basically Jim Comey say that the president in some ways lied, and then Friday, we explicitly heard the president refute that. 
GREENFIELD: Well, you know, I think in the short run — and we’ve talked about this before — the whole impeachment idea is a nonstarter. We don’t have a lot of history about impeachment, but one thing is as long as the president retains the support of his or her party, removal from office is almost impossible. But when the president said publicly he’d be willing to take — to testify under oath before special counsel Mueller, he may have bought himself a world of trouble because once you testify under oath, anything you say that’s false can be used as either a source of a criminal indictment or in the case of a president, impeachment. 
And under those circumstances, I think you would see congressional Republicans, particularly from those in the swing districts, begin to move away from him. The fact of the matter is, right now, whatever his overall poll numbers are, he is hugely popular within his party. 
SREENIVASAN: Yes. 
GREENFIELD: But I do think he set himself up for a potential problem with that statement about testifying under oath. 
SREENIVASAN: All right. Jeff Greenfield, thanks so much. 
GREENFIELD: Yes.

But David Dragon’s memories of where he got it are still fresh.
DAVID DRAGON: I was beaten up and they took me to jail.
EDDIE ARRUZA: The soon to be 94-year-old survivor of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp talks of his experience as he tours a new exhibit about the capture of one of the key architects of the Holocaust: Adolf Eichmann. David Dragon believes he encountered Eichmann at Birkenau.
DAVID DRAGON: When they caught me with some bread they took me in a room and there were about 10-15 high SS men; I think he was there too.
EDDIE ARRUZA: When Eichmann entered a Jerusalem courtroom in the spring of 1961, it was the culmination of years of attempts by the Israeli government to find him and bring him to justice. The backstory that led to that moment is now on vivid display at the Illinois Holocaust Museum in Skokie. Titled “Operation Finale,” the exhibit brings together original artifacts that were only recently de-classified by the Israeli government and curated into an immersive experience by former Israeli intelligence officer, Avner Avraham.
AVNER AVRAHAM: Six years ago I was a Mossad employee and I found some boxes with very rare stuff from the Operation Finale, the Capture of Adolf Eichmann and I decided to put a small exhibition in the Mossad headquarter.
EDDIE ARRUZA: Mossad is Israel’s equivalent of the CIA and in the late 1950’s Mossad was tipped off to a love story involving Eichmann’s son Klaus and this teenage girl, Sylvia Hermann. Sylvia’s father, a German Jew, had fled to Argentina with the rise of the Nazis. Eichmann and his family also made their way to Buenos Aires after World War II evading Allied capture. But when Sylvia’s father recognized the last name of the boy she was dating, he notified Israeli officials. A Mossad agent posing as a tourist, later arrived in Argentina with this Leica Camera and surreptitiously took pictures of the man going by the alias Ricardo Klement.
AVNER AVRAHAM: They sent these pictures to Israel together with Eichmann pictures from SS file that the Mossad got, pictures from the War. And the Israeli police laboratories compared the pictures and find out this is probably the same man if you look at the shape of his left ear.
EDDIE ARRUZA: From there, Operation Finale took off. With Argentina having become a haven for former Nazis and the government not honoring extradition requests, Israel’s Prime Minister at the time David Ben-Gurion approved a clandestine mission to try to capture Eichmann. 12 Mossad agents traveled to the South American country from Europe on separate commercial flights to try to avoid suspicion. These are their airline tickets.
Eichmann was captured on May 11, 1960. He was taken to a safe house where the possessions he was carrying at the time are part of the display. He also had identification with the alias he had taken on in Argentina, Ricardo Klement. But as agents interrogated him, Eichmann eventually tripped himself up.
AVNER AVRAHAM: They start asking him general questions from your age, the size of your shoes and immediately, what is your number of the SS, the SS file and he said exactly the Eichmann number and he understood he made a huge mistake and he asked for a glass of red wine.
EDDIE ARRUZA: Eichmann was smuggled out of Argentina on the only Israeli Airline El Al flight to ever travel to that country.
Adolf Eichmann’s trial began on April 11, 1961 in a converted theater in Jerusalem and the centerpiece of this exhibit is the actual bullet proof booth used by Eichmann along with the three original chairs that he and two security guards sat in.
Visitors to the exhibit can get a sense of the intensity of the trial. A triptych of video screens surround Eichmann’s booth showing videos of the audience, the accused and some of the more than 100 Holocaust survivors who testified.
AVNER AVRAHAM: And the trial changed the life in Israel because people start talking about the Holocaust and people start dealing with this.
EDDIE ARRUZA: Eichmann was found guilty of crimes against humanity and executed in May of 1962. His ashes were scattered in the Mediterranean Sea.

Seriously. How about Comey is going to go to jail for what he did.
Now we certainly know President Trump was never under any investigation because Comey was forced under oath to admit it.
Now we know that President Trump never forced Comey to halt any investigation, even when it is his constitutional right to do so.
Now we know President Trump wanted a quick, swift, complete investigation to see if there was ANY type of collusion by anyone who wanted to work with him.
And President Trump never arbitrarily pardoned anyone, like President Bush did for Casper Wienberger before any investigation.
I know, let me check a credible source. CNN and ultra-liberal, Harvard Law Constitutional Prof Alan Dershowitz 
Legal Scholar Alan Dershowitz spoke with Anderson Cooper on CNN about former FBI Director James Comey's memo about his meetings with Donald Trump. After reading the memo, Dershowitz explained that the President did not obstruct justice because James Comey serves at the will of the President. Dershowitz said presidents have the constitutional authority to impede and direct investigations if they choose. He explained that there is precedent with a president speaking to the FBI Director about investigations, including when President George H.W. Bush ended the investigation of Caspar Weinberger during the Iran-Contra affair. Dershowitz also provided examples from Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Barack Obama who directed their Attorney General or FBI directors to end investigations.

The videos also show Todd Kohlhepp, in cold and emotionless detail, confessing to killing seven people in South Carolina . He pleaded guilty two weeks ago to avoid the death penalty and was sentenced to life in prison. On Friday, prosecutors released several videos, dozens of pictures and hundreds of pages of evidence against him.
""48 Hours: Buried Truth: Confessions of a Suspected Serial Killer"" In the rescue video, once the container was opened after the 10-minute operation, officers walked in carefully with their hands on their guns and found a clothed Kala Brown, sitting on the floor with a chain around her neck stretching to the wall.
CBS affiliate WSPA-TV is expected to exclusively report next week on the case files surrounding Kohlhepp.
Video shows Kala Brown with a chain around her neck as investigators rescue her from a large metal container in South Carolina.
WSPA-TV ""Do you know where your buddy is?"" an officer said.
""Charlie? He shot him,"" she said quietly.
""Who did?""
""Todd Kohlhepp shot Charlie Carver three times in the chest, wrapped him in a blue tarp, put him in the bucket of the tractor, locked me down here. I've never seen him again. He says he's dead and buried. He says there are several bodies dead and buried out here,"" she said.
Investigators found three bodies on the rural Spartanburg County property. They had gone to the land on Nov. 3 to look for Brown and her boyfriend, 32-year-old Charles Carver. The couple had been missing for two months, and Brown's cellphone indicated she might have been in the area when she vanished.
Investigators search a field on property owned by Todd Kohlhepp on Nov. 3, 2016.
AP Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright says deputies heard the 30-year-old woman banging on the walls of the container as they served a search warrant in 2016.
""It was pretty emotional, to say the least,"" Wright told reporters at the time. ""When she was found, she was chained like a dog -- she had a chain around her neck. It's only by God's grace we found that little girl alive.""
The woman and her boyfriend were last heard from in late August 2016, WSPA reports. The missing case gained national attention after suspicious posts appeared on Carver's Facebook page that his family suspected were posted by someone else. The page was later taken down.

Kohlhepp also pleaded guilty to raping Brown. The Associated Press typically doesn't identify victims of sexual assault, but Brown has spoken publicly about her traumatic experience, appearing on Dr. Phil's television show in February .
Authorities say on the way to the hospital, Brown told them about how Kohlhepp confessed to killing a married couple before she was captured, and about killing four people at a Spartanburg County motorcycle shop -- murders that were unsolved for 13 years .
After authorities let Kohlhepp talk to his mother and promised to give her money from his accounts, he confessed in several other videos released by prosecutors.
Kohlhepp bragged in one video about wearing gloves when loading his gun to assure no fingerprints were on the casings. He also told authorities he pulled the gun apart and threw the components into different trash bins, putting the barrel into a bag of used kitty litter.
Even though it had been 13 years, Kohlhepp detailed each shot he fired at the Superbike shop, including final shots to the forehead of 30-year-old Scott Ponder; 52-year-old Beverly Guy; 30-year-old Brian Lucas; and 26-year-old Chris Sherbert.

WSPA-TV ""That was one big building. I cleared that building in under 30 seconds,"" Kohlhepp said. ""I'm sorry, but you guys would have been proud.""
The investigators asked if anyone begged for their lives or said anything to him.

CBS News ""I don't remember any of that. I will tell you that once I engaged, I was engaged. It was almost like a video game. It's not a game -- you've been there, sir, you know what I am talking about,"" Kohlhepp said.
Kohlhepp also killed 29-year-old Johnny Coxie and 26-year-old Meagan Leigh McCraw-Coxie in December 2015. They, like Carver and Brown, were lured to Kohlhepp's land after he promised them work.
Kohlhepp killed Coxie immediately and tried to keep McCraw-Coxie locked away, but he said he killed her after several days because she tried to burn the container after he gave her cigarettes.
""She wanted Little Caesar's pizza. I hate that (expletive). It gives me heartburn,"" Kohlhepp said. ""Dr. Pepper, cinnamon rolls and freaking Newports. If you go down to that building, you'll find an unused package of Newports that I bought for her.""

Kohlhepp denied killing anyone else. He did say he shot a man in Arizona when he was 14, but could give few details. Authorities have not charged him with any additional crimes in other states.
Kohlhepp moved to South Carolina in 2001 after 14 years in prison for a kidnapping in Arizona. Authorities there said the then 15-year-old Kohlhepp forced a 14-year-old neighbor back to his home at gunpoint, tied her up and raped her.","Chilling video shows rescue of rape victim ""chained like a dog""",normal,cf5116d4d9b6039ac5cddaf8adc6f81dc8f70d5a

The U.S. Navy commissioned the warship named for former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ.), a gun violence survivor, making it the third Navy ship ever to be named after a living woman.
Getty The Navy told former Arizona Congresswoman Gabby Giffords a warship would be named in her honor back in 2012 .
The same day she decided to resign from Congress to recover from an assassination attempt in 2011.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised the decision to name the ship after Giffords.

Three men were detained after the easyJet flight from Ljubljana, Slovenia, to London Stansted Airport made an unscheduled stop in Cologne, a spokesman for the German Nordrhein-Westfalen police said. Authorities conducted a controlled detonation of a backpack as a precaution.
The spokesman said the flight was diverted to Cologne-Bonn airport around 6:30 p.m. local time (12:30 p.m. ET) after the passengers told staff that the three men on board were talking about terrorism. The exact wording of what was said was not immediately available.
Authorities are awaiting more analysis about what was inside the backpack and it has not been determined that it contained explosives, police said.
The diversion comes amid heightened fears of terrorism in Europe, and follows a vehicle and knife attack on the London Bridge and in a nearby market area last week that killed eight people. The three attackers were shot dead by police.
Passengers evacuated the plane on emergency slides and police were waiting on the ground, the police spokesperson said. Reuters, citing the Cologne airport, reported that all 151 passengers were evacuated safely from the Airbus 319.
EasyJet said the captain of EZY3246 ""took the decision as a precaution to enable the aircraft to go through additional security checks in Cologne where the aircraft was met by the police.”
The budget carrier said passengers were provided with hotel accommodations and it plans to operate the flight on Sunday morning.
""The safety of easyJet's passengers and crew is our highest priority,” a spokesperson for easyJet said in a statement.
Six aircraft were diverted to other airports as a result of the police investigation, the airport said, according to Reuters. The airport said air traffic was affected for several hours as a result of the incident.",Passenger Jet Diverted to Germany Over Terrorism Statements - NBC News,normal,923827c1cc53b31059df15d9307a52d8eee41bde

It took about ten years to lose in Vietnam. We tied in North Korea in about 4 years. 2014 Obama started bombing Syria, illegally, and committed war crimes. Bush was asleep at the wheel on 911, then tried to save his legacy by diverting attention to starting 3 wars, because 19 muslims used razor blades and our airplanes to cause multi terror attacks at the same time. What part of spin don't people get?
As I write this, two days ago the actual attack on Raqqa took place. It is involving over 200 of US soldiers on the front lines. We have over 1000 82nd airborne troops camped 25 miles outside of Raqqa. Mattis is ""thinking"" about sending 1000 troops to aid our current 200 plus. He means the 82nd airborne guys. You haven't read any of this from US media. It's coming from overseas media, including our guys reporting it.
Since Trump's been at it with Mattis and McMaster killing Syrian women and children, and having a media blackout, they have been letting ISIS escape to Deir Ezzor and Palmyra. It would make it easier to take Raqqa. Out of the 1500 that ""escaped"" with our help, Putin killed about 500 of them, and took out a whole bunch of their weapons, and vehicles. There are about 2500 left in Raqqa. Putin will bomb them the minute they step into the US made route. Mattis also bombed Syrian soldiers two weeks ago, and was given his last warning by Putin. Iran and Hezbolla now cut off the South route between Iraq and Syria.
We are there illegally and committing war crimes. We have zero business there. They elected their government, and most were sunni electing a shia Alawi. Trump isn't going after ISIS. He wants to cut a deal with them. He wants our deep state to set up shop thru them in Deir Ezzor. The oil is there, and Conoco with Phillips 66 (of Prescott and George Bush fame) have refineries there. It is B1 grade oil for jets. Gold.
Afghanistan is over 50% Taliban. It was 20% when Bush sent troops in 2001. So why are our guys dying, and for what.
It's only a movie, but it had facts that will blow you away. Nicolas Cage starred in ""Lord of War"". See it, and read the commentary. Nothing but American war profiteering GREED. How dare anyone suggest we are fighting terrorists ""over there"" to keep them off our streets. We own more guns than you can count. You think we are going to get invaded by gangs of muslims. Sh t. They know better. It's why they are such cowards and use the web to warp the minds of the retards that buy into their religion of peace.
We should have invaded their holy land of Saudi Arabia in 2001. Wiped out every mufti, wahhabi, jihadist, and muslim brotherhood soldier. You treat this scourge like you treat Naziism. You go in, hold Nuremberg type trials, and expose them for who they are. Trump is scum when he shook their hands. We have the largest naval base in Bahrain, and the air base in Qatar. Both support jihadi terrorists.
Trump, Mattis, and McMaster should be hauled in front of our courts for allowing these three soldiers to die. Mattis and McMaster are killing machines, and belong in combat when we want to defeat an enemy. They aren't diplomats in some sort of learning as you go school.
We are either at war or not. We finish them off, and earn the respect of who we set free, then come home.
